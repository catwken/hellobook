## Case Study: Where No Man Has Gone Before

### Reference Point

This case study follows Finn Vortex's journey from the elbow to the  pit. It doesn't include activities leading up to elbow-depth insertion.

### Journal/Blog

#### 01 June 2016

> After multiple attempts (at least 10) by my regular ff-Top  (0050), four fingers are into the splenic flexure about knuckle deep.  Need to continue stretching and pulling down the flexure to straigten  the path.

#### 30 June 2016

> Met 0073 (Enrique) while visiting Salt Lake City, UT. Small  framed guy with 30+ years of fisting experience. In an hour-long play  session, he was able to make it past his elbow so that the olercranon  had passed completely through the first ring (anal canal).

#### 03 July 2016

> Met 0074 (Elias) in Laramie, WY. Shorter guy with thicker  arms. He also took me post olercranon in about an hour long play  session.

#### 31 July 2016

> Met 0081 (Elijah) and reached new levels of insertion.  Elijah is small framed and about five feet tall. He was able to go bicep  deep and get two hands fully into the rectum and past sigmoid.  Unsuccessful in passing the flexure though.

#### 05 August 2016

> With my regular ff-Top (0050), we experienced a tear in the sigmoid colon. See [Case Study: Intestinal Tear](https://web.archive.org/web/20190109001512/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/as_laparotomy.html#study). Further attempts are postponed for probably a year or longer.

#### 15 May 2017

> Added two new toys to my collection after speaking with  Agent Colby on AP. He regularly stretched with Can Opener from Mr  Hankey. Purchased that and Big Daddy XXXL to go with Boss Hogg and Stump  'n Dump. After several weeks of play with these toys, the first ring is  stretched sufficiently enough that the olercranan is no longer too wide  for general penetration, even on medium size hands on average height  men.

#### 11 June 2017

> Met 0130 (Easton) while in DC at FFA. Shorter guy, small  hands, average size arms. He was able to get the olercranan into the  first ring, but not through it.

#### 15 June 2017

> A skilled Top found the stitches from the laparotomy and  intestinal repair much higher than previously thought—past the hump,  near the navel. They are exposed. This means depth is no longer an  option for novice fisters.
