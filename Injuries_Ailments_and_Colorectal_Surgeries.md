## Injuries

As noted in the article [Art & Science: Health & Wellness](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/as_health.html),  fisting is inherently dangerous due to the nature of our anatomy.  Injury rates increase substantially under three specific circumstances: 

- When either partner lacks the appropriate knowledge, experience and skill for fisting (beware of novice fisting partners)
- When engaging in extreme fisting (double fisting, full elbow punching,  or depth fisting)
- When controlled substances that affect judgement and awareness are coupled with play (crystal meth is especially dangerous)

Most medical practitioners will advise against fisting in order to  prevent malpractice lawsuits. Established fisters (those with 20+ years  of experience) are quick to note that most injuries are due to toys or  extremely rough play. Intestinal tears, punctures, and anal fissures are  the most common types of injuries resulting from fisting and general  ass play.

### Intestinal Tears and Punctures

Perforations or tears in the large intestine are deadly if untreated.  Intestinal bacteria will seep into the gut, resulting in infection and  fever.

Perforations or tears in the large  intestine are deadly if untreated. Intestinal bacteria will seep into  the gut, resulting in infection and fever.

#### Causes

Intestinal tears and punctures are naturally uncommon in the  intestine but do happen on occasion when items are inserted into the  fist chute. This type of injury is likely due to unmanicured nails,  high-powered douches, chains, or toys of small diameter with blunt or  sharp edges. Diverticulitis can also increase the risk of tearing. 

#### Symptoms

Initial symptoms may include bleeding, a drop in blood pressure,  clamminess, fever, lack of any bowel movement (intestinal paralysis),  and mild abdominal pain. Over time, air will begin to escape the colon  into your stomach, causing abdominal distress, frequent urination, and  shortness of breath. A CT scan will likely identify the air and possibly  the location of the tear. Fever will gradually increase, especially if  fecal material seeps out into your gut through the tear. 

Untreated tears and punctures are lethal within 48 hours of injury  and treatment should be sought immediately. Be prepared in advance to  discuss with ER triage nurse the nature of your injury. Neglecting to do  so may result in your treatment being delayed several hours, an extreme  exacerbation of symptoms, a more invasive treatment, and potentially  death.

#### Treatment

Treatment usually involves a full laparotomy to determine the site of  the tear. After the tear has been located, its size will determine  further outcomes. Small tears (less than a quarter in diameter) can be  sutured up and patched with fatty tissue. Recovery time for patches is  at least six weeks to normalcy inside the intestine. Tears larger than a  quarter usually involve an ostomy bag and a year-long recovery period  (with an  additional surgery to reconnect the intestine after healing has  occurred). The surgical method of repair for colostomy restoration may  affect your future fisting capacity. If possible, you should request  that your surgeon use traditional stitches and stitching methods (actual  sewing up your injury) instead of the newer O-ring methods. The  traditional method heals without creating a lot of scar tissue that  prevents future fisting.

### Anal Fissures

 ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_icd_fissure.png) ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_hover.png) 

Fissures can appear inside the anal  canal or externally at the opening of the anus. A fissure can look  strikingly similar to a syphilis chancre.

#### Causes

Anal fissures can be caused naturally by large and hard stools,  constipation, and diarrhea. Rough anal sex, toy play, and improper  fisting can also cause fissures. When fisting, copious amounts of the  appropriate lube (not KY jelly), warming up/stretching techniques, and  gradual insertion can prevent fissures from occurring. Know your limits  and follow them.

#### Symptoms

Pain when defecating and blood in the stool are common symptoms of  fissures. Occasionally a rectal itch may occur, especially with  micro-fissures. Bowel movements will continue, but may be at a slower  pace. Note the difference between tears/perforations and fissures. A  tear or perforation will usually trigger natural paralysis of the  intestine (you will no longer shit and the desire to eat or drink will  vanish). 

#### Treatment

The nature of the fissure determines the treatment plan. About 80% of  fissures will heal on their own if fisting is eliminated for several  months, water intake is increased substantially, and a high fiber diet  is adopted. The remaining 20% of cases require a sphincterotomy to  remove or repair the fissure. Twelve to eighteen weeks of recovery time  are suggested to prevent reoccurrence. 



## Ailments

A multitude of naturally occurring ailments can affect a fisting  Bottom. In fact, almost any GI disease (such as Crohn's, IBS, or GERD)  can have an impact on the fist chute and its capacity to gobble up a  hand. Four primary and common ailments include warts, hemorrhoids,  diverticulitis, and cancer.

### Anal Warts

 ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_icd_warts.png) ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_hover2.png) 

Warts may appear internal or external  to the anal canal. If external, a doctor should examine inside the canal  for additional occurrences.

#### Symptoms

HPV is common among most adult gay men, but the strain that causes  warts is less common. Warts will appear around the anus and potentially  along the tissue of the anal canal. Fisting can spread warts throughout  the canal.

#### Treatment

Outpatient service or surgery can remove warts (via burning or  incision). If the warts were along the anal canal that were removed by  incision, six weeks of healing time is desirable. Additional surgeries  may be required to remove future warts.

### Hemorrhoids

 ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_icd_piles.png) ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_hover3.png) 

External piles may harden (become  thrombosed). Six months is the typical duration for the body to dissolve  the clot, often leaving a skin tag.

#### Symptoms

External piles may develop around the lips of the ass at the opening  of the fist chute. Deeper inside the anal canal, internal piles may  develop that will either remain hidden or protrude from the anus similar  to a prolapse. Depending on the size and type, a fister may experience  mild or extreme pain when defecating, getting plowed, or taking a fist.  Bleeding may occur.

#### Treatment

Diet and ceasing of anal penetration (by cock, toy, or fist) can  reduce external and grade 1 and 2 hemorrhoids. Grade 3 and 4 will  require a hemorrhoidectomy and retraining of the fist chute. Fisting  downtime can sometimes be up to two years. 

### Diverticulitis

 ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_icd_diverticulitis.png) ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_hover5.png) 

Tiny pockets form in the large  intestine that can fill with fecal material. If a pocket should explode,  then infection and fever will follow.

#### Symptoms

Symptoms include constant pain (typically in the lower left side of  the tummy), nausea, fever, constipation, and general tenderness.

#### Treatment

Advanced diverticulitis generally means the end of a Bottom's fisting  career. Diet can help, but the risk of exacerbating the condition or  tearing the intestine is too high to continue fisting.



### Cancers & Polyps

#### Symptoms

There are many different types of cancers affecting the lower GI  tract. Colonoscopies are not required (even for FFuck-Bottoms) until age  fifty. Generally unexpected weight loss of gain and swollen nodes are  the first recognizable symptoms. 

#### Treatment

Treatment options vary based on the location, type, and stage of  cancer. Some cancers may be treated laparoscopically, while others  require full laparotomies and ostomies.



## Colorectal Surgeries

Treatment for the above mentioned maladies and injuries may require surgery.

### Laparotomy



Laparotomies involve cutting the abdomen open in order to address an  issue with the GI system. Major laparotomies start just below the  sternum and proceed to two or three inches below the navel. Healing time  is about six months to a year before a patient feels normal.

Keloid scarring is unavoidable, though the size and discoloration can be reduced by using Maderma©,  coconut oil, and vitamin E during the healing period. Since the  abdominal muscles have been cut, mobility is impaired for about six  months and increased fatty tissue can build up which is difficult to  eliminate with normal crunch, planks and other abdominal exercises.



### Ostomy (Colostomy or Ileostomy)



Colostomy  and ileostomies are two types of diversions in the intestine.  Ileostomies usually occur prior to the large intestine (and are less  common for fisting injuries). Colostomies are in the lower intestine.  Both surgeries connect the intestine to an exterior ostomy bag that  fills with bio waste.

In some cases, this stoma is permanent; however, fisting injuries do  not typically fall into this category. The ostomy is reversed after the  intestine heals. At least a year or two of downtime is expected before  fisting can resume.

### Hemorrhoidectomy

To remove grade 2, 3, and 4 piles, a hemorrhoidectomy is often  needed. Depending on the number of hemorrhoids and their severity of  grade, fisting may be put on hold for over a year.

### Sphincterotomy

Fissures that don't heal naturally may require surgery to reseal the sphincter and anal canal. A six-month downtime is expected.

### Appendectomy

Since it is impossible to reach the appendix while fisting, downtime  is limited to the duration of time a body needs to heal (six to eight  weeks).



## Case Study: Intestinal Tear

### Diagnosis

Patient presented in ER complaining of abdominal discomfort after  brachioproctic sexual activity. Upon review of sexual practices/history,  CT scans, and an exploratory laparotomy, a 20mm laceration in the  sigmoid colon, approximately 70mm from the rectum was discovered.

ICD-10: S36.533.

### Operative Report

##### INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE

Finn is a pleasant 43-year old gentlemen who presented to the  emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain after he and his  partner were participating in anal fisting earlier in the morning. The  patient states he felt acute pain during the activity in the pelvic  region as well as in the left upper quadrant. 

A CT scan obtained in the emergency department showed significant amounts of pneumoperitoneum  pneumoperitoneum  (n)

abnormal presence of air or other gas in the peritoneal cavity, a potential space within the abdominal cavity concerning for perforation of the hollow viscus hollow viscus (n)

any orgarn that is hollow on the inside, such as large intestine, small intestine, stomach, or esophagus. Therefore, it was determined that the patient would require an exploratory laparotomy.

All risks/benefits explained. He indicated understanding and consent form signed.

##### DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE

After appropriate consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where he was placed supine supine (a)

laying on the back, face or front forward on the operating table. General endotracheal endotracheal (a)

 placed or passing within the trachea/throat anesthesia was achieved without difficulty.  Bilateral lower extremitybilateral lower extremity (n)

### Journal / Blog

#### 08 August 2016

>  My regular fisting buddy came over for our weekly fisting today, but  things didn't turn out as desired! This was supposed to be a week of  intense fisting and training to reach elbow-depths on long arms and near  pit depth on short arms.
>
> 
>
> Blunt, non-flexible, hard points from these makeshift lube injectors are the most likely culprit for the sigmoid puncture.
>
> We  began our normal fisting routine with one exception: after his hand was  past the sigmoid curve, we injected additional lube with a makeshift  injector. We then resumed forward progression and within 90 seconds, he  was two inches from the elbow—our traditional block! I took a hit of  poppers, and we continued on until he was nearly through the last ring.  Upon extraction, something didn't feel right so I excused myself to the  bathroom. After several minutes, I was unable to expel the additional  150 - 200 ml (3/4 cup) of lube we had injected with the exception of  about 10 ml. That expulsion had a dark red drop of blood.
>
>  As I began to feel clammy, I lay down on the floor of the bathroom and  call the session to an end. My partner began cleanup and after a few  minutes, I joined him in the walk-in shower, only to have to lie down  again. Three minutes later, I had my partner call 911.
>
>  After the EMTs arrived, they determined my blood pressure was extremely  low (90/50) and my oxygen saturation was also low (80% saturation). They  helped me dress and provided oxygen. After several minutes my BP and  oxygen returned to normal levels, so I sent them back to the station and  lay down for a nap. 
>
>  After four hours of napping, my temperature had risen to 100.1 degrees.  After another hour, the temperature had risen to 100.3 so my fisting  partner brought me to the ER. I followed the 
>
> script
>
>   previously prepared for such emergencies. After five hours and a couple  of CT scans that determined my bowels were full of air (a sign of  perforation), I went into surgery. 

#### 09 August 2016

> The surgery wrapped up at about 1:00 AM with most of the  time spent navigating through scar tissue from the previous laparotomy,  appendectomy, and cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal). I'll have to  keep oxygen tubes, nasogastric tube, and catheter for at least  twenty-four hours. My scar goes from the sternum to below the navel and  has about seventeen staples. The nursing staff come and poke me every  couple of hours, but thanks to the Morphine and Dilaudid, I am able to  sleep. 

#### 10 August 2016

> They removed the oxygen and catheter today! It makes it  easier to walk, but it's hard as hell to sit up, and my back is tired  from lying in bed. I might get to eat tomorrow (ice chips are getting  old)!

#### 11 August 2016

> The NG tube came out today. I'm getting tired of being woke  up every two to four hours. Visitors are now coming daily. We play games  and talk. Then I take morphine. No food yet, but they have approved gum  and jolly ranchers. 

#### 12 August 2016

> Clear Liquids! Popsicles, broth, juice, morphine! The goal is to walk every day, sit up as long as possible, and pass gas!

#### 13 August 2016

> More clear liquids. I've got a thousand doctors (mostly med students) that check on me every day.

#### 14 August 2016

> Liquid diet starts today with ice cream, cream soups and Jello. I finally passed gas!

#### 15 August 2016

> Solid foods for breakfast and discharge. It was seven days  in the hospital from admission to discharge. The laparotomy has actually  decreased my original scar. I've lost 15 pounds, and I'm very bloated.  The next phase just includes monitoring bowel movements, increasing  daily activity, and resting.

#### 16 August 2016

> Sleeping is most of my day and night. Neighbors are starting to show up to visit, but I'm not really in the mood.

#### 18 August 2016

> Went to see my regular doctor today. We dropped the Truvada  for a while, and got some additional painkillers (Tylenol 3 with  Codeine). He advised against any fisting in general because of the  danger involved (regardless of surgeries or not). He also mentioned  there was some biopsy reports that are not in the discharge papers. He  suggested I visit a gastroenterologist. I immediately booked an  appointment for Monday.

#### 22 August 2016

> Visited gastroenterologist today. I had an incident at the  doctor's office prior to the appointment where I started getting clammy  and lightheaded. BP and oxygen was good and bowel sounds are normal. I  took a suppository because it was two days without a BM. He advised  against depth fisting and only shallow rectal penetration.

#### 25 August 2016

> Visited the general surgeon today. He removed the 17 staples  and listened to the stomach. Everything is going as planned. He says  that the strength of the intestine should return to normal strength  after six weeks. Previous biopsy of tissue returned normal results.

#### 27 August 2016

> My complaints and issues now deal with constipation,  posture, and pain in the kidneys. I've lost all desire to eat, though I  can walk around the block and I did make it to the grocery store on my  own yesterday.

#### 01 September 2016

> I'm now able to walk about two miles per day, but there is still abdominal pain when sneezing and when riding on bumpy roads.

#### 15 September 2016

> Minor abdominal pain still exists; however, I'm able to  sleep on my side without having residual pain for the remainder of the  day.

#### 17 September 2016

> Took my first fist in the rectum (below injury site) and toys up to the sigmoid. No issues seen or reported.

#### 17 October 2016

> Taken several fists and begun rectum and canal stretching  for medium hand double wide.  Some pain felt after. Also spoke with  acquaintance that knows great details about how patches are fixed in the  GI tract and how long to wait. He said the silk stitches will take a  year to dissolve and the prolene stitches are permanent.

#### 7 November 2016

> Pelvic surgeon fisted me today and said he can feel the  patched area just past the sigmoid. He advises another six to nine  months before depth fisting.

#### 03 February 2017

> Fisted guy who had colostomy due to toy play accident. He  says he waited two years before fisting and another year before fisting  past injury.

#### 12 February 2017

> Took SquarePeg Slink XL past tear today. Minor pain followed.

#### 13 March 2016

> Took Holmes and Hung/BAM past tear today. Minor pain followed.

#### 05 April 2017

> Took Mr. Hankey's *Stump and Dump* two inches from the base. Sloughing of intestinal lining visible. Pink.

#### 12 April 2017

> Took ffriend's hand past the second ring. Pinkness and sloughing occurred during session.

#### 06 May 2017

> Small build top (5'3" / Small Hands) fisted me to his elbow today. Pink.

#### 14 June 2017

> Medium build top (5'11" / Medium Hands) fisted me to his elbow today. Pink on third full insertion.



## Medical Advice

Disclaimer: I am not a physician and cannot offer any medical advice  regarding fisting after an injury. If injured, you should make your own *informed* decisions regarding your future fisting activity.

After my surgery, I queried several people regarding the capacity to  fist again. I group their advice into these three categories: 

- Medical Professionals

- - - Key
    - ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_letter_h.png)  Gay/Homosexual
    - ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_letter_f.png)  Fister

  - *General Surgeon* - Intestine will return to normal, pre-surgical strength within three to six weeks, just like a cut on your external skin. 

  - *Gastroenterologist* ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_letter_h.png) - All ass play (fucking, toys, fisting) should be limited to the rectum (nothing near or further than the injury itself). 

  - *Radiologist* ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_letter_h.png) ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_letter_f.png) - Follow the advice of your gastroenterologist.

  - *General Practitioner (PA)* ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_letter_h.png)  - Fisting at any level discouraged because lack of nerves and sensory  system inside the GI Tract. Stitching could tear with large  objects/pressure.

  - *Gynocological/Pelvic Surgeon* ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_letter_h.png) ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_letter_f.png)  - Wait nine months to a year before having an internal examination by a  fisting medical professional (for depth play). Permanent stitching  should not be a problem.

  - *Medical Assistant (Gastroenterology)* ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_letter_h.png) ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210631im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_lap_letter_f.png)  - Wait at least six months for standard stitching, or a year for silk  stitching to desolve. Fisters treated by our group that have returned to  full fisting within 90 days of surgery have re-opened their wounds   Stitching could tear with large objects/pressure.

- Fisting Tops with 25 Years of Experience

- - *Hand size: Small* - Fisted four guys with injuries.
  - *Hand size: Small* - Fisted four guys with injuries very slowly, with some staying in rectum.

- Fisting Bottoms with Perforations, Tears, or Ostomies

- - *Colostomy in Sigmoid* - Post injury fisting past repair site (also has four friends with similar injuries and fisting results).
  - *Colostomy in Descending* - Post injury fisting past repair site after three years.
