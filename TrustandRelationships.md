#### Executive Summary

Overview of relationships critical for developing fisting and depth  fisting practices, including a definition of roles, development of  trust, power exchanges, and personality. Also includes registry of  clubs, bars, events, and more.





## Trust and Control

### Building Trust

Trust is the most important ingredient for successful fisting.  Without it, the Bottom cannot enjoy the playtime fully due to the  inherent dangers of fisting. Likewise, the Top may not achieve full  arousal upon brachial penetration if he knows the Bottom is on edge  (unless, of course, he's a sadist).

There are several factors that will enhance or diminish trust. Keep  in mind the opposite of each enhancer or detractor affects levels of  trust in the inverse direction.



​           

### Power Dynamics

Perhaps the counter-intuitive and ironic part about fisting is that  although it seems the Top would be the assertive partner, he is not. The  Bottom controls the scene. Tops that do not understand this dynamic  destroy the trust needed for Bottoms to accept their fists.

Tops usually find fisting erotic because Bottoms are literally  placing their lives in their hands. This surrender of basic defenses and  protections stimulates intense chemical reactions in the Top's brain.  Bottoms derive pleasure from not only the penetrative act, but the  connection attained by the surrender the fist chute to another.

Incidentally, fisting in the gay world is rarely a BDSM activity.  When approached as such, the most powerful stimulation and connections  are often lost.



## Playmates, Mentors, and Coaches



There are three types of fisting relationships: coaches, mentors, and  playmates. Regardless of the type of relationship, these three factors  are important for successful fisting:

- Compatible Anatomies — Anatomical  considerations related to the Top include fist size, arm length, arm  circumference, left/right handedness, flexibility, and body positioning  limitations. Restrictive factors for the Bottom include hole plasticity,  pelvic bone aperture, intestinal organization, and body positioning  limitations. The Top and Bottom need to mesh in all areas for continued  progression.
- For example, my coach has a very long  arm with a medium size left fist. We are both flexible in body  positioning so he can quite easily pass through my hole, aperture, and  then manipulate the difficult turns and limitations of the upper fist  chute.
- Trust — Because there is inherent  danger involved in fisting, trust is extremely important. Even if you  consider a coach or mentor's 'responsibility' is to push limits, that  pushing should only be outside the chute in the form of sexual banter  and emotional support. At extreme depths, the Bottom needs to know the  Top will stop forward progression or movement immediately when  requested.
- Knowledge — The best partners know general anatomy, your specific road map, and the fisting body language and subtle cues of the Bottom.

### Playmates

My first ff-Bud had small, collapsable wrists and a wealth of  knowledge about all things fist. He introduced me to giving and  receiving, and in time to both a single and double fist. Our  relationship progressed from coach, to mentor, to playmates. 

As playmates, we just fisted or fucked each other. There was no fist  chute training, nor education efforts that happened in our sessions. 

### Mentors

Mentors can give and take a good fisting. As such, they are able to  teach, learn, and share fisting insights with each other in ways that  playmates and coaches cannot. Mentors are very helpful in elbow-depth  and extreme depth fisting because Bottoms can learn more about their  anatomy by topping the mentor.

### Coaches



Coaches are usually Tops that press and extend the Bottom's limits through play sessions and education. 

#### Coaching the Coach

As a child, you probably learned about sex from your siblings or  friends. It wasn't a comprehensive lesson, but a tidbit here and there.  Fisting is the same way. You may pick up a bit here and a bit there, but  a good Bottom can train a virgin fister into a coach within two or  three sessions.

#### Mentors versus Coaches

The primary difference between coaching and mentoring is experience  as both the Top and Bottom. While most coaches may have been fisted  previously, they generally don't bottom on a regular basis. Mentors, on  the other hand, are versatile in their fisting abilities and have a  unique perspective based on those abilities.



## Connections: Registry of Bars, Baths, Organizations, Events, and APPS

You can find coaches, mentors, and play partners through friends,  clubs/organizations, specialized events, bar nights, and online.

### Events, Bars, and Organizations

Additional [content](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210621/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/as_coach.html#updates) for this section is in development. Want to [contribute](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210621/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/m_resources.html#content)?

Prior to the personal computing revolution and the ubiquity of smart  phones, gay bars were the primary source for hooking up and locating  ff-Buds. By [flagging red](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210621/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/history.html#hanky),  you could establish a 'walking fist fuck profile'. You could also join  clubs or organizations dedicated to the wilder side of homosexual  copulatory activities in order to find ffriends. Although bars and baths  are on the decrease, new and existing clubs and organizations still  play a vital role in the fisting community.

### Online Searches

#### There's an APP for that (and sometimes a website)

Most hookups originate online in this day and age. When hooking up  with an online trick for the first time, take standard safety  precautions (especially for those of you in the closet): let somebody  know who you are going to meet, meet in public, vet the guy via chat or  txt, get his actual phone number.

Notes: Guys here are generally honest,  straight-forward, and to the point here. Profiles have optional sections  for HIV status and PNP which helps spur conversations regarding  boundaries established in screening processes.  



##### Recon

![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210621im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/r_ex_recon.png)

Notes: Probably the mother of all fetish APPs out  there—with specific criteria for searches and designations of kinks  allowed in profiles. I've found it is best in the EU and outside the  American South (where guys are still uncomfortable about coming out with  their specific fetish).



##### Scruff

![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210621im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/r_ex_scruff.png)

Notes: Results from this smart phone APP can vary  by city. Some cities prefer to use Grindr, Jacked, or other apps over  Scruff. Generally, the guys on here are more open to the idea of fisting  than on other apps.



##### Adam4Adam

![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210621im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/r_ex_a4a.png)

Notes: Not specifically dedicated to fisting, but  the guys here seem pervier than Manhunt, Scruff, or Grindr. Guys online  between 12:30 AM and 6:00 AM tend to be using one of the alphabet drugs.



##### Manhunt

![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210621im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/r_ex_mh.png)

Notes: Regional usage varies. Since the owners  support Republican causes, I rarely use except when above the  Mason-Dixon line. If you have expanded search, you can find guys into  fisting.



#### Your Profile

Represent yourself appropriately. Don't be an Apphole.

## Storytime: Death by Fisting

### Give me a Tall Latte and an Ambulance

To say Emerson was a little crazy was an understatement. Rational  people rarely repeated a fisting session with him due to his almost  universal breaches in every category of trust. Unfortunately, James was  unaware of his reputation.

The fisting date started out normal enough (less a few  eccentricities), but eventually turned sour. People would later whisper  that the demise was due to drug use coupled with and an over abundance  of poppers, but the truth remained hidden from the general public.

Emerson and James' session was well underway when Emerson  accidentally perforated the intestine. Complications led to a drop in  blood pressure and ensuing cardiac arrhythmia. Normal people would call  911, but not Emerson. He showered, packed his gear, vacated the premise,  went to Starbucks, ordered a latte, and called 911 from a distance (as  being caught at a fisting death would be too much for his wife to  handle). 

In the meantime, James passed away. He had told his friends  previously (in jest) that he wanted to die while fisting—sadly his wish  came true!
