## Eye of Mordor

 ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20180517090925im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_pop_figures_mordor.png) Heavy hitting of poppers may result in  a conscious blackout and a yellow dot inside the field of vision. This  is often called the 'Eye of Mordor'. 

Poppers were first synthesized in 1844 by Antoine Jérôme Balard, but  it took the sexual revolution and the disco scene in the 1960s to  popularize their use as a recreational drug and fisting facilitator.

When inhaled, the active ingredient in poppers (NO2—) triggers certain physiological responses and some health-related concerns.



### Physiological Experience

There is very little scientific research into how poppers interact  with the body. The most die-hard popper enthusiasts have theorized what  causes the various physiological responses by extrapolating  commonalities from studies on laughing gas (N2O), by basic knowledge of human physiology, and by personal experience. 

#### Poppers and Fisting

At least three primary physiological effects of amyl/butyl nitrites  can enhance fisting experiences: smooth muscle relaxation, increased  sensitivity, increased libido.

#### Measured Physiological Response

Huffing poppers generally causes the following reactions/responses in your body:

| Time (Seconds) | Event/Physiological Response                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 03 - 10        | Your first inhale results in a feeling of  lightheadedness and inner tingle. Your nervous system triggers the  relaxation of smooth muscle tissue, specifically within your circulatory  system. |
| 11 - 25        | Your skin tingle and environmental awareness  increase while your head, face, and chest flush with color. Your blood  pressure begins to drop precipitously. Your libido increases, and your  remaining smooth tissue relaxes (your hole opens up for deeper  penetration). During the next 15 seconds, you will have the most success  surpassing previous fisting limits. |
| 26 - 35        | Your heart begins to pump with tremendous force,  and your heart rate begins to accelerate to accommodate the dilated  blood vessels. |
| 36 - 60        | Your breathing becomes deeper and without  training, much more rapid as your body requests air—all systems of your  body are reacting fully to the hit. Your senses are at their peak,  demanding attention. |
| 61 - 90        | Your poppers rush dissipates, and the heart  begins to restore normal BP. You notice your heartbeat all over your  body. Your cock begins to deflate (if not stroked or inhibited by a cock  ring). |
| 91 - 180       | Your heart begins to pump normally and its BPM  return to normal. Your head begins to ache in response to the heavy flow  of blood. |

### Health Concerns

#### Vasodilation Effects (Short Term)

Vasodilation refers to the widening of blood vessels. It results from  relaxation of smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls, in  particular in the large veins (called venodilators), large arteries, and  smaller arterioles. When blood vessels dilate, the flow of blood is  increased due to a decrease in vascular resistance; therefore, dilation  of arterial blood vessels (mainly the arterioles) decreases blood  pressure.

Short term side effects of popper vasodilation may include: chest  pain, heart palpitations and irregularities (fluttering or pounding  heartbeat), rapid heartbeat, fluid retention, nausea or vomiting,  dizziness, headache, flushing, and nasal congestion.[ [1\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20180517090925/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/as_poppers.html#R1)  Individuals with heart conditions should consult a physician before inhaling poppers.

#### Cynonsis

![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20180517090925im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_pop_figures_lips.png)A single hit of Blue Boy poppers results in blue lips / dick.

Extreme popper use and certain amyl or butyl isomers can cause blue lips, blue nails, and even blue dick.

 The medical term for this condition is *cyanosis*, after the  color CYAN. While cyanosis can normally have many causes, with poppers,  it is due to a buildup of methemoglobin inside the bloodstream.



'Poppers catalyze the enzyme that keeps methemoglobin levels in the  blood low by turning it into hemoglobin (which is necessary for proper  oxygen exchange with our cells). The buildup of methemoglobin in our  blood causes the paleness/blueness of skin and lips, etc. There isn't  much you can do to avoid this if you're popping [hitting poppers]. It's  not necessarily dangerous unless you have certain conditions, in fact if  you were to measure your blood oxygen level you'd see that it's normal.  However, too much methemoglobin in your blood can be a problem, so like  anything just be careful and remember to let your body recover.'[ [2\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20180517090925/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/as_poppers.html#R2)

#### Retinal Damage

Nitric oxide regulates the photoreceptor functionality in the eye.  When inhaling poppers, the extreme saturation of nitric oxide can result  in a temporary disruption of normal eye functions which can lead to  long term damage. Case studies have shown complete loss of vision,  blurred vision, or blockage of visual fields.

#### Cancer

Studies show that an increased consumption of sodium nitrites (in  bacon, ham, and other processed meats) has a 67% increase in likelihood  of pancreatic cancer. Some theories infer poppers could also increase  cancer rates, but there are no studies to confirm these speculations.

#### Depression

Amyl and butyl nitrites are classified as depressants. They bond  temporarily with opioid receptors inside the body and once released, can  cause fatigue and depression due to chemical imbalances. Users report  this haze takes as little as 30 minutes or as much as 6 hours to wear  off. Some users aren't adversely affected at all.

#### Migraine Headaches

Vasodilation, methemoglobinemia, and retinal stimulation can all contribute to headaches, including migraines.

#### Loss of Erection(s)

Even though they are vasodilators like Viagra and Cialis, with  repeated and heavy use, they tend to kill a boner instead of make one  harder. This is true especially for men of older age. It is helpful to  attain wood first with a tight cock ring before taking hits.

- Fisting Tips with Poppers

- Keep a handful of Ricola cough drops to use if  you get congested. Your sinuses will open up so you can resume powerful  hits and deep play.
- Hydrate during play and pop several aspirin once the session ends to reduce or eliminate headaches.
- Apply artificial tears before and after a hot shower to help your tear ducts recover from the drying effects of nitrites.



## Chemistry

### Chemical Formulas

The active ingredient in poppers that causes the euphoric rush is the molecule nitrite (NO2).  Nitrite refers to two oxygen bonded to a nitrogen molecule, and should  not be confused with nitrate, which has a third oxygen molecule (NO3).  Although poppers are commonly referred to as amyl nitrate, this is  incorrect. Amyl nitrate is (and always has been) a diesel fuel additive.  

Attached to the nitrite module is a string of carbon:

- A four-carbon string  (C4H9-), commonly referred to as butyl, or  
- A five-carbon string (C5H11-), commonly referred to as amyl (officially as n-pentyl).   

   ![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20180517090925im_/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/images/as_pop_figures_3d.gif)   Butyl nitrite has four carbons, while amyl nitrite has five carbons. 

Various different prefixes represent how the carbon is organized. The  most common are iso, which indicates the molecule has multiple *siblings* with the same atomic make-up, and cyclo which indicates the carbon atoms are bonded together in a ring. 

Poppers were either simple amyl- or isobutyl- nitrites in their  original format; however, legal restrictions (EU), production costs, and  market forces have introduced various formulas to the popper huffing  world. Those formulas include some hexyl isomers, various butyl isomers,  and the eight amyl/pentyl isomers.



The preceding section is based on my basic understanding of organic  chemistry and my personal study; however, I'm no expert—nor claim that  the information is correct. All attempts have been made to limit the  information presented to simple facts. Most popper web sites report  incorrect data.

### Chemical Properties (Maintaining Freshness)

The chemical properties of amyl- and isobutyl- nitrates has played an  important role in popper packaging. The carbon/nitrite bond is not  strong enough to maintain integrity when subjected to the normal  environments of our daily lives (light, temperature, and air). As a  result, poppers were originally sold in single-use, breakable glass  vials to maintain potency. Since this packaging doesn't accommodate  sexual play, manufacturers have designed packaging to address these  issues:



- Bottles are made of dark glass to reduce light-induced reagents.
- Airtight caps prevent the atmosphere from continually reacting with the nitrite.
- Labels suggest storing poppers at lower temperatures to keep them fresher longer.
- Desiccation capsules or powder in the bottles prevents excessive water build up in your bottle.



## Brands and Vendors

### Acquisition

There are several manufacturers providing poppers to the market;  however, the end product is only available at adult stores and online.  These are my primary online sources:

###### Details

This site is a popper resaler, and you can typically get big bottles  for the price of small ones (in your local adult novelty store).

Unfortunately, you have to pay by e-check, which isn't hard to set up  and complete; however, your bank will list 4solvents on your statement.  For this reason, I knocked off 1.5 stars.



### Evaluation Criteria

Since 2010, there has been an explosion of poppers on the market.  There are multiple websites that appear to evaluate poppers; however,  they are often fronts for actual vendors.

Human physiological differences affect individual responses to poppers. Many guys like *RUSH*, but all it does for me is create migraine headaches three hours later.

I've attempted to evaluate the most common brands of poppers by using comparison matrix and these categories:

Popperbating helps you goon-up on poppers and release a pent-up load.  From a fisting perspective, popperbating videos—often called 'popper  trainers'—are helpful for personal stretch sessions with toys. There are  two types of popper training videos. The first type (and most common  video), is compilation sequences with porn integrated with clips from  every-day guys jerking off. The second type involves a trainer  conducting a one-on-one popperbate session. 

By far, the best source for one-on-one training videos is PoppersGod.  He's kink-friendly (though probably not a fister), and you can  commission a related popper training video for a small tribute.
