Storytime: The Handshake!
-------------------------

### The Very True Story of Edwin and his Techniques

关于Edwin的真实故事 

To say Edwin was eccentric was an understatement. As I recall, his home was truly unique. For example, his doorbell chimed Christmas tunes, even during the hot, humid months of summer in the Deep South. He charismatically refered to his home as _Eddie-land_ and the bedroom was just as unique as the rest of his home. A permanent sling was attached to the four-poster bed and was specifically set up for fisting with strategically placed lube pods, paper towels, and a stool for the penetrating partner. But enough about Eddie-land—this story is about the handshake.

用古怪来描述Edwin太不够了。他的家看起来特别独特。





Before I'd even arrived, he'd messaged me on Adam4Adam and said, _"Just ring the doorbell when you arrive. The door's unlocked, and you can come on in, but let me have some warning."_ I did as he had requested, and worked my way back past a huge pipe organ in his living room, a toy train that would make even Santa jealous, and some animatronic, life-sized, life-like reindeer that moved by motion sensor. Once inside the room, I noticed he was already in the sling and ready to go.



_"I'm Edwin"_ he said. _"Let me give you my famous handshake!"._

I reached out to shake his hand and he said, _"lube's right there"_ while pointing to a small tupperware container of what I assumed was Crisco. _"I guess he's foregoing the handshake,"_ I thought to myself as I dipped into the lube. I was a little nervous as this was my second-ever fisting session (my first had been at least five years prior to the date).

_"I'll walk you through it!"_ he said as he started small talk about the organ and his eccentricities while coaching me to spread Crisco around his hole and start the "opening up" process. I did as was told, and eventually, I had three fingers in his eager hole.

_"At this point, see if you can feel the ring—it's not made of the same stuff as everything else down there. It's harder. Put your three fingers on it and massage it—stretching it out from its contracted state."_ I continued with his instructions, rotating my hand with the three fingers pressing against the ring till I'd made several round trips. It then became four fingers and a repeat of the same streching technique I'd used moments ago with three fingers.

_"Now make a scissoring motion with those fingers to increase the stretch, and just keep rotating while pushing gently in until the thumb also joins in. We are almost there."_

_"Where?"_ I replied.

_"Pull your thumb into your palm and begin cupping your fingers at the knuckle... ...wa la! That's it!"_ In one fell swoop, he contracted his muscles and pulled my hand and wrist into his hole. _"And that's the Edwin Handshake!"_ he said as he kegelled his hole around my wrist.

Basic Stretch Considerations
----------------------------

Before starting your stretch, consider the following items:

开始扩张肛门之前，要准备一些东西 

*   Lubrication - Use copious amounts of lube specific to the type of play or toys. J-Lube or xanthum gum work universally for flesh, silicon toys, or latex toys.
* 润滑剂： 根据玩法和工具的不同，需要大量的润滑剂。J-Lube和 黄原胶可以用于肉体，硅胶玩具和橡胶玩具。
*   Foreplay - When stretching with a partner, foreplay can make a difference. Although rimming does not stretch a hole, it physiologically relaxes the anal canal and sphincter.
* 前戏： 当有伴侣协助扩张时，前戏会带来不同的体验。虽然亲吻身体并不能扩张菊花，但是这些方式能够从心理上放松菊花和肛门括约肌
*   Temperature - There are various temperature concerns:
    *   Hands should be the same temperature as the body core of the Bottom.
    *   Toys should be at or slightly above body temperature.

* 温度：关于问题有几点考虑
    * 要插入的手应当接近受的深部体温（深部体温一般是指肛门内部的温度，因为在环境温度较低的时候，人的皮肤温度会远远低于正常体温）
    * 使用的玩具的温度要稍高于体温


    ![AHaa 这里有张图哦](images/as_str_figures_basic_thermometer.png)
    
    *   Creams and solid lubes should be at room temperature or warmer if possible.
    *   Liquid lubes should be above the body temperature of the Bottom by five to ten degrees.
    * 膏状或固体的润滑剂温度应当接近室温，如果可以的话应当更高
    * 液体的润滑剂温度应当高于受的体温3-6摄氏度
    *   Room temperatures vary based on Bottom's tastes - I prefer anything 72 degrees or warmer. Cold rooms contract skin and freeze hands!
    * 室温取决于受的喜好，建议不要低于22度，室温太低会导致皮肤紧缩，还会让手冰凉
*   Communication - Bottoms should let Tops know how/where to start and continue leading the session until termination. For example, I find one or two fingers uncomfortable and prefer to start with at least three or four fingers. I also have specific places that are more comforatable resting zones which must be communicated to the man who's elbow is about to disappear into my hole.
* 交流：受要告诉攻什么时候开始，如何开始。 并且要全程主导后面的所有活动。 比如“我觉得一两个手指插入并不舒服，希望开始的时候就插入三四个手指。” 。。。。。
*   Boundaries and Limitations - Most anal fissures and intestinal perforations/tears are the result of forced toy play or inexperienced Tops. Stretching is a gradual exercise and success is measured in millimeters, not centimeters (or inches). If stretching the lower fist chute, stop when you feel burning. For depth play, never push into a wall! Follow the channel always.

Exercises/Techniques
--------------------

### Techniques for Self Play

Solo activities can increase the competence of the Bottom for partner play. These activities facilitate/precede any partner stretching exercises:

*   Double and triple toy penetration with average dildos. Use three standard width dildos to penetrate the hole. This trains your muscles and mind on relaxing enough to let multiple items inside you (cock and hand, toy and hand, two hands). If possible, stay shallow (inside the rectum) to avoid injury.
*   Finger stretching on extra-large toys. This duplicates the technique of inserting a second hand once the rectum is full (see below).
*   Resting-point challenges. Plug yourself with an extra-large toy at full depth for 5, 10, or 15 minute periods. Do not increase or decrease depth during the insertion period. This helps create comfortable resting places for your fisting routines.
*   Butt Plugs. Plugs may loosen the first ring, but are generally useless in the fisting process because the tapered part does not mimic the anatomy of the anal canal and rectum.

### Exercises with Partners

The following training exercises instruct Tops how to increase the stretch for both shallow and depth fisting:

    ### Steps / Procedure
    
    1.  Massage the the taint and hole for two minutes without finger insertion.
    
    ![](images/g_unavailable.png)*   Communicate with the Bottom regarding styles and comfort levels during this time.
    *   Start dry (or with the hole lubed from rim-job spit) with a simple petting motion.
    *   Apply lube to insertive hand and repeat the petting process to ensure that the taint, hole, and hand are well lubed.
    
    3.  Insert fingers into the hole and massage the anal canal gently.
    
    ![](images/g_unavailable.png)*   Start with the base finger count if two (or more if specified by the Bottom).
    *   Push the fingers gently deeper until fully inserted.
    *   Curl the top knuckle and pull down, applying pressure to the top of the anal canal.
    *   Circle around the entire hole with the tug/pull-down motion for about two minutes.
    
    5.  Introduce additional fingers into the anal canal.
    
    ![](images/g_unavailable.png)*   Stretch the ring by opening your fingers in a scissor motion and twist inside the hole.
    *   Retract the fingers and introduce additional fingers (following the process in Step 2).
    *   Repeat the tug/pulldown and scissoring procedure until all four fingers are inside the anal canal.
    
    7.  Pop the hole and ring:
    
    ![](images/g_unavailable.png)*   Position the thumb along palm, pointing between the middle and ring fingers.
    *   Insert the fingers and thumb and repeat the curl and tug process applying.
    *   Popper up the Bottom.
    *   Apply pressure and encourage the Bottom to relax and bare the additional pressure to swallow the fist.
    *   Curl the knuckles as the Bottom pulls you past his ring and swallows your wrist.
    
    #### Aftercare
    
    New Bottoms should wait at least a week before repeating a session. Even with proper lubrication, there will be micro-tears to his hole until he can easily take a fist.
    
    #### Tips
    
    *   Petting the taint and hole triggers a subconscious physiological response in many Bottoms to relax the muscles in the anal canal.
    *   Overstimulating the sphincter with excessive fingering may cause irritation and contraction of the hole, preventing entry. Avoid unnecessary finger play.
    
    #### Mastery/Progression
    
    Repeat this procedure until the Bottom can maintain a fist within his hole for several minutes.

    ### Steps / Procedure
    
    1.  Locate the second ring.
    
    ![](images/g_unavailable.png)*   Massage/work the hole as needed to prepare for fist acceptance.
    
    *   Push and retract (in gradual motion) until four fingers are inside the hole.
    *   Twist and probe to locate the channel to the second ring and sigmoid colon.
    
    3.  Insert full hand into rectum.

    *   Continue the push and retract motion from Step 1.
    *   Pop the first ring and insert to the wrist.
    
    5.  Train the ring for penetration.
    
    ![](images/g_unavailable)*   Insert two fingers into the ring and massage the about half of the opening with a curl and tug motion (no twisting of wrist).
    *   Stretch the ring by opening your fingers in a scissor motion and _non-wrist based_ twist inside the hole.
    *   Notify the Bottom you are going to rotate your hand 180 degrees.
    *   Rotate the hand and repeat the tug/curl/pull-down and the scissoring on the remainder of the ring.
    *   Repeat the tug/curl/pulldown and scissoring procedure until all four fingers are inside the ring.
    
    7.  Prepare for popping the ring:
    
    ![](images/g_unavailable.png)*   Position the thumb to rest parallel to the pointer finger.
    *   Position the hand for penetration
    :
    
    *   For right-handed fisting, the palm to face the Bottom's right side.
    *   For left-handed fisting, the palm will face the Bottom's left side.
    
    *   Insert and retract the hand in a gentle motion till at the widest point of hand.
    *   Make sure your fingers are in the channel and not pressing up against a wall.
    
    9.  Pop the ring:
    
    *   Notify the Bottom to popper up for the final push.
    *   In the gentle insertion and retraction, push past the widest part of your wrist.
    *   Follow the channel and stop moving once past the wrist.
    
    11.  Pop the final ring:
    
    *   Follow the channel to the last ring (will take several months and inversion of arm).
    *   Locate and pull the ring (splenic flexure) down for training.
    *   Repeat the preparation/training process for popping the ring.
    *   Reposition the transcending colon into a straight path (no walls).
    *   Repeat the ring popping process.
    
    #### Aftercare
    
    No specific aftercare is needed for depth insertion. The stretch capacity is very high and the
    
    #### Tips
    
    *   While there is no ring where the sigmoid meets the descending colon, the S curve will require a lot of work to pass.
    *   It will take months to move along the sigmoid and descending colon to reach the final ring. Go at a snail's pace.
    
    #### Mastery/Progression
    
    Repeat this procedure until the Bottom can maintain a fist within his hole for several minutes.

    ### Steps / Procedure
    
    1.  Stetch the hole for double penetration.
1. 为双拳做的扩张准备
    
    ![](images/g_unavailable.png)*   Insert four fingers of each hand into the hole with palms together.
双手手掌相对，各自插入4个手指
    *   Rub the palms together in a seesaw motion to expand the anal canal and first ring.
摩擦手掌，同时做旋转动作，以扩张肛门括约肌
    *   Remove fingers and reinsert with palms facing outward.
抽出手指，双手手掌向外插入
    *   Rotate around the hole increasing the stretch while massaging the ring.
绕着菊花洞旋转以按摩并扩张括约肌
    *   Remove hands when ready to begin final insertion.
抽出双手以准备最终的冲刺
    
    3.  Insert the larger fist.
插入更大的拳头
    
    ![](images/g_unavailable.png)
*   Determine with the Bottom if the fist should remain in the rectum or deeper past the second ring.
跟受确认拳需要保持在直肠还是深入过第二括约肌.
    *   Reach a comfortable resting place, preferably at the narrowest part of the arm.
让攻的手找到一个最舒适的保持位置，一般是胳膊上最细的位置


    5.  Introduce additional fingers into the anal canal.
把更多的手指插入肛门
    
    ![](images/g_unavailable.png)
*   Insert a single finger alongside the wrist of the inserted fist.
保持一个手已经插入的情况下，在手腕附近开始插入一个手指
    *   Add addtional fingers and stretch the ring by opening your fingers in a scissor motion.
插入另外一个手指，并且打开手指做剪刀运动，以扩张肛门
    *   Press all four fingers into the hole up to the thumb joint.
插入全部四个手指，深入到拇指根部
    
    7.  Pop the hole and ring:

    
    ![](images/g_unavailable.png)
*   Popper up the Bottom with very long hit.
    *   Position the thumb flat on top of the pointer finger.
    *   Brace the hands and allow the Bottom to push back to accept the full wrist.
    *   Encourge pistoning and wiggling left to right until wrist is accepted completely.
    
    #### Aftercare
    
    Bottoms should wait at several days before repeating a session. Even with proper lubrication, there will be micro-tears to his hole.
    
    #### Tips
    
    *   After inserting the first wrist, moving the fingers around the hole 360 degrees helps stretch the hole.
    *   After passing the two fist barrier, the methodology for double fisting can change to allow the Bottom to be completely passive.
    
    #### Mastery/Progression
    
    Congratulations, you've reached the pinnacle of fisting.

Toys
----

Every training routine should involve toys of progressively larger size. The following resources are available for integrating toys into your play sessions and preparatory activities:

*   [Art & Science: Toys](as_toys.html) - Using toys appropriately will prevent injuries while increasing depth capabilities. This article reviews how to integrate toys into your fist chute training and ass play sessions.
*   Evaluations and Reviews - I host a Tumblr which catalogs my toys and wish lists. You can review the [dildos](https://unabated-toybox.tumblr.com/tagged/dildos) and [butt plugs](https://unabated-toybox.tumblr.com/tagged/butt plugs) that I've collected or ridden throughout my fisting years.
