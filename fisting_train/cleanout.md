Your Douching Routine
---------------------

适用于每个人的灌肠方法并不完全相同，确切地说，每个人的灌肠方法变化很大。对于某些人来讲，清洗过程将会花掉大半天时间，然而其他人完成一次深入的冲洗也就是几分钟的事。



A working knowledge of the fist chute helps you direct your douche activies appropriately and can make the difference between a five minute or a five hour douche routine. Toys can also play an important role in your douche routine to help validate you are ready to proceed playing.

It will likely take you several months or even years to develop a routine that works for you, especially for depth play. To help you develop your routine, consider the following questions:

1.  How does my body react to...
    *   The food I eat? Are certain foods better than others for helping me clean out? What can I eat before play and when can I eat it?
    *   Pharmaceutical supplements? Does fiber or certain laxatives cause irritation inside me? What about anti-diarrheals? Do these items affect me negatively and prevent a good fisting session?
    *   Water being injected into my ass? Is it readily expel by my system, or do I need to work and massage it out?
    *   Water temperature and salinity content? Does hot water irritate my hole? How about cold water? Or hard/soft water?
    *   Different douche nozzles? Are there certain materials or styles that agitate my hole unnecessarily?'
2.  How much prep time do I need based on my body's reaction to douching activities?
3.  Will I require touch ups prior starting a play session?

To help answer some of those questions, included below is information on [Diet](#diet), [Tools](#tools), and Techniques ([my own](#techniques) and those from [several experts](#Fist_Tips)).

Digestive Activity
------------------

### Diet饮食控制/节食

一些受提倡在重大的拳交活动前禁食24小时，并且在这之前的24小时控制饮食。但是这种方法只适用于以下情况

* 拳交或其他活动会持续超过四五个小时
* 在整个活动进行中没有可用的清理设施
* 你的玩法需要第三极灌肠/清理
* 深拳交到上臂或肩膀深度

![](images/as_was_diet_banana.png)

即使符合以上列出的一些条件，也可能无需调整饮食或者节食。只要你了解我们的身体如何处理食物，可以参考下面的表格以便调整饮食

Even if some of the above items are true, it may still not require a modification of your diet or even a fast. Only you will know how your body processes food. Refer to the [timing table](#timing) to help determine how to modify your diet.

Monitor your hydration and electrolyte balance on the day of your fisting. Your fast and douche technique can result in a depletion of essential minerals and fluids. After your session is over, help yourself to a banana to restore potassium or to yogurt to help restore culture to your intestine (even though it's nearly impossible to douche out your existing culture).

### Timing

Cleaning out involves knowing your body well, including patterns in your digestive activity.

From a scientific standpoint, it usually takes thirty-three hours for food to pass all the way through the system; however, this varies based on your [diet](#diet). Starchy foods take longer than fruits and vegetables, and dairy foods and meat elongate the the timing of your bowel movements. Once food reaches the small intestine, it follows the first-in, first out rule (there are no passing lanes).

Your normal body clock also plays a key roll as peristalsis can be triggered by waking up in the morning or by eating a meal.

For depth fisting, you should consider when to douche based on your diet, the time of day, the planned depth (forearm, elbow, bicep, armpit), your [technique](#techniques), and the approximate time of your sexual activity.

|Type of Food |Stomach | Small Intestine | Large Intestine |
|----|----|----|----|
|Liquids|15 - 30 Minutes|15 - 30 Minutes|15 - 30 Minutes|
|Fruits|20 - 40 Minutes|1 - 3 Hours|2 - 4 Hours|
|Vegetables|30 - 60 Minutes|2 - 4 Hours|2 - 4 Hours|
|Carbs\*|1.5 to 3 Hours|3 - 8 Hours|10 - 24 Hours|
|Dairy|1.5 to 5 Hours|2 - 8 Hours|6 - 18 Hours|
|Meat|.5 to 5 Hours|6 - 8 Hours|10 - 24 Hours|

### Steps / Procedure

1.  Prepare the cleaning area:

![](images/as_was_techniques_01-01.gif)*   Attach the appropriate nozzle to your showershot. If desired, apply lube to nozzle.

*   Adjust shower temperature to 70°F / 21°C.
*   Adjust pressure to a slow to moderate flow (WARNING: high flows can damage your insides).

2.  Take a first pass at the anal canal and rectum:

![](images/as_was_techniques_01-02.gif)*   In your most comfortable position (laying, sitting, or standing), insert the enema and empty it's contents into your fist chute.

*   Wait several minutes and expel (in either toilet or drain).
*   In the same position, insert the douche two to three inches deep.
*   Squeeze down on the douche tube or nozzle (keigel) to retain the water being introduced into your hole.
*   Rotate the douche in every direction, taking as much water as possible.
*   Empty the excess water introduced into your rectum (in either toilet or drain).

3.  Finalize the cleanse:

![](images/as_was_techniques_01-03.gif)*   Repeat the douching portion of step two multiple times but increase the depth each time until five or six inches into the fist chute. Do not enter the sigmoid.

*   With each expulsion, monitor the water color. Once discharge is clear, fill the rectum with water.
*   Jump, dance, or jiggle to swish the water around your chute, keeping it inside as long as possible.
*   Expel the water. If clean, you are ready for a shallow fisting.

#### Advice and Tips

If you are squeamish about fecal material, you may want to expel the fluid into your commode.

If you find that you are leaking water during your fist or fuck sessions, introduce a dildo into your cleaning routine to open your hole (common practice in [Douche - Level 2](#L2) and [Douche - Level 3](#L2)).

With this level of douche, you should not try to go extremely deep. Deeper is definitely not better. Remember the [anatomy](as_anatomy.html) of the fist chute. You are only going to need to clear the rectum. If you get too high, then the fecal materal in the sigmoid will become watery and leak into the rectum. This leakage will continue throughout your fisting session and will likely cause an early termination of play.

Some guys will need a refresher douche immediately before play, especially if you douched too deep for a shallow fisting.

### Steps / Procedure


​    
Steps / Procedure

1. Prepare the cleaning area:

- Attach the appropriate nozzle to your showershot. If desired, apply lube to nozzle.
- Adjust shower temperature to 70°F / 21°C.
- Adjust pressure to a slow to moderate flow (WARNING: high flows can damage your insides).

2. Cleanse the anal canal and rectum:

- In your most comfortable position (laying, sitting, or standing), insert the douche two to three inches deep.
- Squeeze down on the douche to retain the water being introduced into your hole.
- Rotate the douche in every direction, taking as much water as possible.
- Empty the excess water introduced into your rectum (in either toilet or drain).
- Repeat as needed until expulsion is clear, inserting the nozzle to a maximum of six inches.

3. Cleanse the sigmoid and descending colon:

- Repeat step three multiple times but insert the nozzle the full five or six inches to the base of the nozzle. With each expulsion, monitor the water color.
- Once discharge is clear, fill the rectum with water.
- Jump, dance, or jiggle to swish the water around your chute, keeping it inside as long as possible.
- Expel the water. If clean, you are ready for a shallow fisting.

4. Empty excess water:

- Insert the dildo to full depth and complete a thirty to sixty second dildo fuck on yourself.
- Squat and remove the dildo.
- Monitor expelled water color and repeat steps two and three as needed until clean.

#### Advice and Tips

Get over your squeamishness regarding fecal material and expel liquid content into your shower. Make sure your drain works well prior to starting a deep cleanse.
    
Some guys will need a refresher douche and dildo fuck immediately before play to validate cleanliness.
    
At this depth, you may want to trigger peristalsis prior to your play time to make sure you are completely clean. Give yourself an extra hour for cleanout if you do. To trigger peristalsis, insert a butt-plug that replicates 55 Torrs of pressure inside your rectum (at least fist size). Maintain the plug inside you as long as possible doing normal activity outside the shower, then expel and re-douche. You may want to avoid this process if peristalsis terminates your body's ability to take a fist.
    
Douche Level 3 - Cleaning for Pit Depths
----------------------------------------

*   Supply Warehouse
*   Preferred: Colon snake
*   Acceptable: Showershot with depth nozzle
*   Preferred: 18 inch doubleheaded dildo, standard width
*   Ideal: Medium-sized Goose dildo
*   Optional: Immodium
*   Optional: Lube

*   Goals, Purpose & Duration
*   Goal: Cleansing of transverse colon
*   Purpose: Pit depth fisting or 12 hour play sessions
*   Duration: 20 to 60 Minutes

*   [Print these instructions](documents/training_douche_level_3.pdf)
*   [View the demonstration](video/douche_level_3.mpg)

### Steps / Procedure

1.  If possible, defecate prior to entering cleaning area.
2.  Prepare the cleaning area:

![](images/as_was_techniques_03-01.gif)*   Attach the appropriate nozzle to your showershot. If desired, apply lube to nozzle.

*   Adjust shower temperature to 70°F / 21°C.
*   Adjust pressure to a slow to moderate flow (WARNING: high flows can damage your insides).

3.  Complete a [Level 1](#L1) and [Level 2](#L2) douche.
4.  Fill the transcending colon:

![](images/as_was_techniques_03-02.gif)*   Lay yourself down on your right side in the cleaning area.
*   Insert the colon snake douche to full depth (36 inches minimum).
*   Fill the colon with liquid and remove the douche either completely.
*   Stand up, jump, and twist to swish the water around your transcending colon.
*   Enjoy a relaxing shower for five to ten minutes.

5.  Empty the transcending colon:

![](images/as_was_techniques_03-04.gif)*   In a standing position, massage your stomach in a worm-like fashion from left to right just above your belly button.
*   Lie down on your right side and repeat the massage in the same fashion and direction.
*   Dildo-fuck the living hell out of yourself (alternating between the Goose and full 18 inch insertion) for three to five minutes.
*   Repeat your [Level 2](#L2) douche in order to expel the contents from the descending colon.

6.  Repeat steps four and five until the expelled water is clear.
7.  Take immodium to temporarily stall all peristalsis until your session is over.

#### Advice and Tips

You may need a refresher [Level 2](#L2) douche immediately before play.

Diet is especially important for pit depth fisting. And hydration with electrolytes (Gatorade) is also imperative when emptying colon at this depth.

Tools
-----

The following tools can be used to clean out:

*   [Pharmaceuticals](javascript:HideAllShowOne('pharmaceuticals'))
*   [Bulbs](javascript:HideAllShowOne('bulbs'))
*   [Shots](javascript:HideAllShowOne('shots'))
*   [Nozzles](javascript:HideAllShowOne('nozzles'))

Select a category of tools for additional information.

### Pharmaceuticals

Pharmaceutical items include oral anti-diarrheal medication, anal suppositories, and oral/anal laxatives.

LAXATIVES

![](images/as_was_tools_pharmaceuticals_laxative.png)

ANTI-DIARRHEALS

![](images/as_was_tools_pharmaceuticals_ad.png)

Suppositories
-------------

###### Overview

Anal/Rectal suppositories are a small, wax-like (1 inch | 2.5cm) objects that are inserted into the anal canal. Once inside, they melt and deliver a laxative.

var mySIndex = 0; suppositorycarousel(); function suppositorycarousel() { var i; var x = document.getElementsByClassName("mySuppositorySlides"); for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x\[i\].style.display = "none"; } mySIndex++; if (mySIndex > x.length) {mySIndex = 1} x\[mySIndex-1\].style.display = "block"; setTimeout(suppositorycarousel, 8000); // Change image every 4 seconds }

The distribution of the laxative is rapid, and fluid is almost immediately drawn back into the lower intestine. The increased fluid results in increased bulk and an increase in pressure (Torrs) within the rectum. The rectum and sigmoid then expel their contents, often at a faster pace than normal laxatives.

Like regular laxatives, they decrease the control you have over your bodily functions. Your body may take minutes or hours to finally expel all of your intestinal contents and the triggering chemicals from the suppository. This could negatively affect any immediate play sessions.

Douching will be required to clean any remaining fecal material from your system.

Laxatives
---------

###### Overview

Oral laxatives speed up peristalsis to expel stool at a faster rate than normal digestive timing.

![](images/as_was_tools_pharmaceuticals_laxatives_01.png) 

var myLXIndex = 0; laxativecarousel(); function laxativecarousel() { var i; var x = document.getElementsByClassName("myLaxativeSlides"); for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x\[i\].style.display = "none"; } myLXIndex++; if (myLXIndex > x.length) {myLXIndex = 1} x\[myLXIndex-1\].style.display = "block"; setTimeout(laxativecarousel, 8000); // Change image every 4 seconds }

There are four categories of oral laxatives and WebMD has a great [article](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/tc/laxatives-topic-overview) on how they work. For fisting, stick with the fiber laxatives and avoid the remaining three categories unless you have experimented with them and know exactly how your body reacts to them (their side effects during a session may introduce complications and extra shit that will decrease your play time).

You may also want to consider a Zinc supplement to bind fecal material together, decreasing the amount of tissue paper you need to use after you defecate.

Anti-Diarrheals
---------------

###### Overview

Anti-diarrheals temporarily slow the automatic movement (peristalsis) in the intestine, causing delays in the time it takes food and liquid to complete the digestive processes.

![](images/as_was_tools_pharmaceuticals_anti-diarrheals_01.png) ![](images/as_was_tools_pharmaceuticals_anti-diarrheals_02.png) 

var ADIndex = 0; antidiarrhealscarousel(); function antidiarrhealscarousel() { var i; var x = document.getElementsByClassName("myAntidiarrhealSlides"); for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x\[i\].style.display = "none"; } ADIndex++; if (ADIndex > x.length) {ADIndex = 1} x\[ADIndex-1\].style.display = "block"; setTimeout(antidiarrhealscarousel, 8000); // Change image every 2 seconds }

When used in combination with other clean out tools/methods, their use can result in longer sessions of uninterrupted play.

Take after completing your full douche routine as you still need some stomach movement to help in your cleanout routine. The active ingredient takes about an hour to kick in, depending upon your biology, and will last three to four hours.

Bulbs include disposable enemas and douches. The market for reusable douche bulbs has attracted adult product vendors to re-imagine and redesign the old female douche bulb.

DISPOSABLE ENEMA

![](images/as_was_tools_bulbs_disposable_enema.png)

DOUCHE BULBS

![](images/as_was_tools_bulbs_bulb.png)

Disposable Enema
----------------

###### Overview

Single-use disposable enemas introduce four to eight ounces of fluid into the rectum.

![](images/as_was_tools_bulbs_disposable_01.png) 

var myBulbIndex = 0; bulbcarousel(); function bulbcarousel() { var i; var x = document.getElementsByClassName("myDisposableSlides"); for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x\[i\].style.display = "none"; } myBulbIndex++; if (myBulbIndex > x.length) {myBulbIndex = 1} x\[myBulbIndex-1\].style.display = "block"; setTimeout(bulbcarousel, 2000); // Change image every 4 seconds }

After injection, the combination of increased volume and laxative causes expulsion of rectal contents. Multiple refills are needed for full cleanliness.

Disposable enemas are readily available in pharmacies. Plastic water bottles (without the cap) can even be used as a substitute in a pinch.

Most disposables are pre-filled with sodium phosphate, mineral oil, or saline. They can easily be refilled with water.

Douche Bulbs
------------

###### Overview

Refillable douche bulbs introduce 6 to 15 oz of fluid into the fist chute and are easily portable for touch up and remote cleaning. They can be also be filled with lubrication and emptied into the ass for slicker depth play.

![](images/as_was_tools_bulbs_douchebulbs_01.png) ![](images/as_was_tools_bulbs_douchebulbs_02.png) ![](images/as_was_tools_bulbs_douchebulbs_03.png)

Douche bulbs can be purchased in the feminine hygiene area for actual douching, or they can be purchased from specialty stores for anal douches.

Unfortunately, bulbs can introduce air/gas into the intestinal tract which may cause some inflexibility and blockage when fisting, especially around loops and bends.

Enemas
------

###### Overview

Enemas are typically a closed system, where a fluid-filled container, tube, and gravity empty water into the fist chute.

![](images/as_was_tools_shots_enemas_01.png) ![](images/as_was_tools_shots_enemas_02.png) 

var myEnemaIndex = 0; enemacarousel(); function enemacarousel() { var i; var x = document.getElementsByClassName("myEnemaSlides"); for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x\[i\].style.display = "none"; } myEnemaIndex++; if (myEnemaIndex > x.length) {myEnemaIndex = 1} x\[myEnemaIndex-1\].style.display = "block"; setTimeout(enemacarousel, 8000); // Change image every 4 seconds }

A flush enema clears fecal material immediately while a retention enema scrubs a little before expulsion. See [Home Enemas: How and Why](http://bodyecology.com/articles/home_enemas_how_and_why.php).

Enema bags are easily explained to prying eyes, whether travelling through airport security or storing at home.

Because of the gradual introduction of water, clean out times are long and routines are complex, especially for depth fisting.

Shower Shots
------------

###### Overview

Shower shots attach to a water source and allow for adjusting of flow for extensive, rapid cleaning.

![](images/as_was_tools_shots_showershots_01.png) 

var mySSIndex = 0; showershotcarousel(); function showershotcarousel() { var i; var x = document.getElementsByClassName("myShowershotSlides"); for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x\[i\].style.display = "none"; } mySSIndex++; if (mySSIndex > x.length) {mySSIndex = 1} x\[mySSIndex-1\].style.display = "block"; setTimeout(showershotcarousel, 2000); // Change image every 4 seconds }

Shots can be conveniently attatched to existing shower heads or existing hand held units. They use the principles of modern plumbing to supply water for injection.

With the appropriate nozzle (and there are many different options), clean out is fast and effective.

Recent innovations include shots that connect to your toilet supply valve, so a full shower is no longer necessary to clean out the fist chute.

Portable Shots
--------------

###### Overview

Portable shots are a hybrid between enemas and showershots.

![](images/as_was_tools_shots_portable_01.png) 

var PSIndex = 0; portablecarousel(); function portablecarousel() { var i; var x = document.getElementsByClassName("myPortablesSlides"); for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x\[i\].style.display = "none"; } PSIndex++; if (PSIndex > x.length) {PSIndex = 1} x\[PSIndex-1\].style.display = "block"; setTimeout(portablecarousel, 8000); // Change image every 2 seconds }

These shots slip over the showerhead to divert flow into an 'enema-like' bag. Gravity then injects the water into the fist chute. Occassionally, flow can be interrupted because your anatomy may block the nozzle.

When not in use, they can easily be stored out of site; however, to prevent mold growth, the shot should be allowed to dry completely before final storage.

Showershots and bulbs need nozzles to introduce fluid into the fist chute. Nozzles include shallow/depth nozzles, irrigators, and colon tubes.

Basic
-----

###### Overview

Basic nozzles have three defining characteristics: length, firmness, and material.

var myBIndex = 0; basiccarousel(); function basiccarousel() { var i; var x = document.getElementsByClassName("myBasicSlides"); for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x\[i\].style.display = "none"; } myBIndex++; if (myBIndex > x.length) {myBIndex = 1} x\[myBIndex-1\].style.display = "block"; setTimeout(basiccarousel, 8000); // Change image every 4 seconds }

Sizes vary from short (about 2 inches | 5cm) to long (about 20 inches | 50cm). The most common size nozzle measures 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12cm).

Basic nozzles are firmer than irrigators and colon tubes. They lack the flexibility needed for deeper insertions. They are most effective in the rectum and lower sigmoid colon.

These nozzles can be made of stainless steel, aluminum, rubber, latex, plastic, and silicone.

Irrigators
----------

###### Overview

Irrigator nozzles are defined by longer lengths, greater flexibity, and water infusion methodology.

var myIRIndex = 0; irrigatorcarousel(); function irrigatorcarousel() { var i; var x = document.getElementsByClassName("myIrrigatorSlides"); for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x\[i\].style.display = "none"; } myIRIndex++; if (myIRIndex > x.length) {myIRIndex = 1} x\[myIRIndex-1\].style.display = "block"; setTimeout(irrigatorcarousel, 8000); // Change image every 4 seconds }

These nozzles measure between 10 inches (25cm) and 20 inches (50cm). The extended length reaches deeper into the fist chute. Less rigid materials such as silicone, rubber, or latex are used in the design.

Another defining feature is water injection. These nozzles irrigate from sides and sometimes the tip of the nozzle. This allows the folds of the deeper fist chute to be washed cleaner before depth plunges.

Colon Tubes
-----------

###### Overview

Colon tubes are the final class of nozzles. A majority of fisters do not use colon tubes because they aren't seeking bicep- and pit-depth insertions.

![](images/as_was_tools_nozzles_colontube_01.png) ![](images/as_was_tools_nozzles_colontube_02.png) ![](images/as_was_tools_nozzles_colontube_03.png)

var CTIndex = 0; colontubecarousel(); function colontubecarousel() { var i; var x = document.getElementsByClassName("myColontubeSlides"); for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) { x\[i\].style.display = "none"; } CTIndex++; if (CTIndex > x.length) {CTIndex = 1} x\[CTIndex-1\].style.display = "block"; setTimeout(colontubecarousel, 8000); // Change image every 2 seconds }

The extended length of these tubes introduces water into the transverse colon. Lengths run 25 to 40 inches (60 to 100cm). The deep injection of water causes extended cleanout time.

The most effective colon tubes are made of medical grade silicone and have some girth to them to prevent folding back on themselves inside the fist chute.

## Storytime: My First Douche

### The narrative about my first clean out

_Even though..._ I'd lost my virginity years prior, and...

_Even though..._ I'd had sex with a half-dozen guys, and...

_Even though..._ I'd had a live-in boyfriend for several years...

I had never heard of cleaning out. This all changed in Metarie, LA with a guy named Evan. Evan and I met on Manhunt™ several weeks prior to our first physical encounter. The delay in hooking up was due to a couple of things:

1. The 70 mile trek between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, and...  
2. My general inexperience in the gay universe—I was still very young and curious, and most of my sexual encounters to that point had been with guys that were _'New to this thing'_ (like me).

Evan eventually invited me to New Orleans for an evening play date. I gladly made a trip to New Orleans, spending a day in the French Quarter seeing the sights, and then stopping in for an evening play session with him.

Once I arrived at his house, we exchanged small talk, made out, and then he asked if I had prepared.

> 'Prepared? Sure, I guess, I mean, I think so.' I stuttered.
>
> 'I mean, have you cleaned out?'

He must have noticed the puzzled look on my face, so he continued.

> 'By that, I mean douching, so your ass is clean—cause I'm going to fuck the hell out of you.'
>
> 'I don't know what that means. I've never douched.' I said, slightly embarrassed.
>
> 'No worries, I'll show you the ropes.'

Instead of throwing me out the door, he grabbed me by the hand, led me to the bathroom, got down on his knees, and rooted around beneath the sink: out came a box of Fleet enemas.

Sensing my uneasiness, he introduced some foreplay into the routine. He pulled me down, and we made out for a bit before stripping each other naked. Then he had me roll over. Before I knew it, I was laying on my left side with a disposable enema being emptied into my ass. He refilled the enema and emptied it two more times before I needed to expel the water. Fortunately, I was clean.

> He asked, 'Are you always that way?'
>
> Without even thinking, I replied: 'Usually. About 90% of the time, I suppose.'
>
> 'Your hole must be tight and talented!' he quipped back.

And _even though..._ I hadn't learned sexual vocabulary such as 'hole' and 'tight', nor did I understand the implications of what he was saying, I responded.

> 'I guess we'll find that out shortly!'

We then fucked like dogs. If there was any _Hell_ inside me, he fucked every last bit of it out.
