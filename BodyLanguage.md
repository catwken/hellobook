## 言语之外的迹象和征兆Non-Verbal Signs and Signals

Non-verbal communication during a fisting session can communicate  pleasure, pain, and passion. Specific actions or observed reactions  relay how a fisting procession should proceed.

### Hand Signals

在进行拳交时，受可以通过肢体语言与攻进行沟通When fisting, a Bottom can use non-verbal cues to communicate with the Top. The following cues are best relayed face-to-face:

#### Forward/Deeper进一步/更深入

Signaling 'come forward' with the hand indicates to increase pressure  and forward motion deeper into the fist chute. The speed of the signal  can indicate the pace of progression.

#### Stop/Hold

Presenting the hand with the palm-out and finger raised denotes  stopping at the current position. Signing for forward progression,  twisting, or pistoning will proceed further action by the Top.

#### Reverse/Shallower

While in the Stop/Hold position, wagging the fingers means pull back gently until otherwise directed.

#### Piston

Moving the fist back and forth at various speeds and lengths signals  to the Top to stop forward progression in favor of expanding the fist  chute via pistoning.

#### Twist

Twisting the fist from right to left at various speeds indicates the  Top should stop forward progression in favor of stretching out and  stimulating the fist chute in his current location. 

#### Tap/Rub

Tapping the Top's leg, thigh or arm could mean a variety of things.  Discuss before starting if it means stop, slow down, go faster, apply my  pressure, piston, twist or pull out. 

### Eye Contact

'Where, when, and how we look at others are all part of the  phenomenon of eye gaze, one of our most important and primitive means of  communication. Gaze plays a crucial role in conversation. Looking at  another person is a way of getting feedback on particular points. It is  also used as a synchronizing signal.[[1\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210616/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/as_body.html#R1) 

In fisting, people can communicate subconsciously via eye contact via  pupil dilation, blinking, squinting, and opening/closing eyes.  

- Pupil Dialation. Pupil dialation  indicates sexual arousal on part of both the Top and Bottom. Large  pupils in a Bottom usually increases the level of attraction by the Top.
- Gazing. Gazing and averting gaze can  indicate the following messages: invitation into personal space  (including the fist chute), determinination of power roles and power  relinquishments, and trust alignment through calmning persuasion. 
- Blinking. Increased blinking is a sign  of attraction and synchronized blinking indicates trust between  partners. Decreased blink rates by the Bottom indicates control over  body functions (thus signaling capacity for deeper penetration). 

### Body Movements

A Bottom may do several things with his body to facilitate depth or  width. A good top can read these pushbacks, arches and drops and adjust  his approach appropriately.   Shifts that realign the hips and pelvis can direct a fist up the fist  chute.

## Subconscious Physical Reactions

### Popper Blush



One of the easiest signs for a Top to read during fisting play is *Popper Blush*. Once the blush sets in, the involuntary muscles have relaxed enough to proceed to the next push, piston, or twist. 

The window of opportunity for this thrust varies based on physiology  and popper strength. I typically inhale four times and count back from  five to let my partner know when to start up the fist chute.

Refer to the article, [Art & Science: Playing With Poppers](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108210616/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/as_poppers.html) for detailed information on how poppers integrate into fisting play.

### Jumps or Pullbacks

Ever wonder why the dentist knows when to ask if your numbing agent  is wearing off? It's cause he is trained to look at the eyes and body  for unexpected movements. Tops should observe the Bottom for jumps or  jerks to make sure they are navigating the fist chute appropriately. 

## Touch

Touch always trumps verbal messaging during all aspects of a fisting  encounter. The right level of touch and caress can improve the intesity  of a session and elasticity of a hole. 

| Event       | Area of Focus                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Foreplay    | Face, Hands, Ass, Genitals        |
| Penetration | Thighs, Stomach, Feet, Torso/Nips |
| Aftercare   | Calves, Back, Temples, Neck       |

## Grunts, Growls, and Moans

Copulatory vocalizations often accompany sexual activity including  fisting. Sexologists posturize multiple evolutionary reasons for them,  such as conveying information and internal synchronizing your central  arousal systems (movement, smell, touch, sound). Essentially we make  sounds that drive us to orgasm—and hopefully—orgasm together. 

These vocalizations are typically non-verbal sounds such as grunts  and growls, but some words or linguistic phrases are also part of this  sexual banter. For example, *Oh Yeah*, *God*, *Fuck Me*, and *Deeper*  make little cognitive or contextual sense when already fucking or  fisting at the armpit, but their utterance stimulates the scene.

With regular ff-Buds, these sounds can replace other non-verbal  communication forms, especially when fisting in positions that prevent  face-to-face contact. With new partners and anonymous fisting, these  vocalizations direct each other on techniques and practices to increase  pleasure.
