### Prepping Your Chute

If playing local (anywhere within an hour commute), the bottom should  clean out at his place. There are some exceptions to this rule, such as  discretionary play, unexpected pop up fisting dates, or delayed access  to douching facilities (perhaps due to day at the office or a night out  on the town). Otherwise, a bottom should come prepared to play without  having to cyle through a major clean-out.

This is not to say the host shouldn't be prepared for a minor  touch-up, as sometimes the stomach acts out unexpectedly. The bottom  should follow his general guidelines and douche up a level for the  expected type of play. For example, if he's planning on shallow fisting,  he should complete a [Level 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20190109001537/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/as_wash.html#L2) cleanout instead of a [Level 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20190109001537/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/as_wash.html#L1) douching.

## Group Fisting Etiquette

When attending a fisting party, follow these rules of participation:

1. Prepare in advance: 	
   - Bottoms: Modify your eating schedule and douche appropriately for the type of play expected.
   - Tops: Trim and clip your nails (even if gloves are required).  Review post-fisting hand/arm cleaning procedures to avoid cross  contaminating bottoms.
2. Pack your supply bag appropriately.  	
   - Bottoms: Make sure you include pads and your own lube.
   - Tops: Include gloves that fit your hand size, clean-up soaps/materials, and hand sanitizer.
3. Practice good hygiene: 
4. Respect others' play scenes: 	
   - Ask permission to watch or participate. If the answer is no, move on without making a scene.
   - Respect the house rules. If it's a substance free party, do not use prior to or during the event.
   - Stay out of the bubble. Invading personal space can affect the  connection between top and bottom. The environment may dictate the size  of the bubble, so be conscious of the size of the room and the amount of  people there. Conversely, if you are the top or bottom, realize that  your bubble shrinks as based on the size of the room.
   - Do not use other peoples equipment unless direct permission is  granted. 'Use your words' to ask permission. Generally asking directly  can put somebody in an awkward position to say no, so you may have to  develop a conversation and get a feel for the sharing capaciity of your  conversant.
