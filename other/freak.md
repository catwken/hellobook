# How to be Freak in bed

Have you ever heard the saying that men want a “lady in the streets and a freak in the sheets”? It seems like men want a freaky woman, and men who have those women are likely to brag about it! But if you don’t necessarily consider yourself a freak, the entire idea might be intimidating.

But if you can get over whatever’s holding you back, you might be surprised to learn how being a freak in bed can lead to better sex and a hotter relationship!

您是否听说过男人想要“街上的女士和床单上的怪胎”的说法？似乎男人想要一个怪异的女人，而拥有那些女人的男人很可能为此吹牛！但是，如果您不一定认为自己是个怪胎，那么整个想法可能会令人生畏。

但是，如果您能克服阻碍自己前进的一切，那么您可能会惊讶地发现，躺在床上的怪胎如何导致更好的性爱和更热烈的关系！

## How to Be A Freak In Bed

As you can probably guess, there’s no single way how to be a freak in bed. Some people think anal sex is freaky, but you don’t necessarily need to be into anal to be a freak. In fact, it’s less about the specific acts and more about your attitude toward sexploration!

正如您可能会猜到的那样，没有什么办法可以成为床上的怪胎了。有些人认为肛交是怪异的，但您不一定非要肛交才是怪胎。实际上，这与特定行为无关，而与您对性倾向的态度有关！

1. Be Open to Suggestion

Your man wants to have sex in the car or kitchen? He wants to add toys. Perhaps he suggested the two of you watch porn together. All of those things can seem pretty freaky if you’re a do-it-in-the-bedroom-before-bedtime person. However, being open to suggestion is the first step to being freaky in bed.


    公开征求意见

你的男人想在汽车或厨房做爱吗？他想添加玩具。也许他建议你们两个一起看色情片。如果您是睡前在卧室做事的人，那么所有这些事情似乎都怪异的。但是，坦率地提出建议是卧床不起的第一步。

2. Enjoy Sex for Yourself

If you’re always down to try something new but only because your man wants to, neither of you will get as much out of sex as you can. It’s good to be willing and game, but if you’re not really enjoying sex, it can feel like it’s fake or all for show, and no one wants that.

So learn to enjoy sex for yourself. You might not like everything you try, but most women can usually find something to enjoy during sex whether it’s the joy of being looked at, clitoral stimulation, oral sex or fantasizing in their heads.

My most powerful sex tricks and tips aren't on this site. If you want to access them and give your lover back-arching, toe-curling, screaming orgasms that will keep them sexually obsessed with you.



为自己享受性爱

如果您总是想尝试一些新事物，而仅仅是因为您的男人想这么做，那么你们两个人都不会尽可能摆脱性生活。乐于和人打交道是件好事，但如果您不是真的很喜欢做爱，可能会觉得它是假的或全部都在表演，没有人想要。

因此，学会自己享受性爱。您可能不喜欢自己尝试的一切，但是大多数女性在性交时通常都能找到一些喜欢的东西，无论是被看的喜悦，阴蒂刺激，口交还是脑海中的幻想。

我最强大的性爱技巧和窍门不在此网站上。如果您想访问它们并让您的爱人后仰、,脚，尖叫高潮，这将使他们对您的性行为保持痴迷。

3. …And Make Your Own Suggestions

Don’t just leave it to him to spice things up or initiate sex. Take the reigns yourself! Let your man know some freaky sex ideas you’d like to try, even if it seems a little out there. Chances are, he’ll think it’s hot that you’re contributing and will love seeing you so turned on when you do try it.

Talking about sex can be difficult, so check out our [guide to sexual communication](https://badgirlsbible.com/sexual-communication) to get it right.

并提出您自己的建议

不要只是把它留给他来刺激事情或发起性爱。亲自掌权！让您的男人知道您想尝试的一些怪异的性爱想法，即使看上去有些怪异。很有可能，他会认为您正在做出贡献很热，并且很乐意在尝试时看到您如此打开。

谈论性行为可能会很困难，因此请查看我们的性爱交流指南以正确进行。

5. Have Confidence

Everyone has hangups about their sexuality. Perhaps you’re worried that your tummy is too round or that you don’t sound “hot enough” during sex. Your man is probably worried about the size of his penis and whether he can keep it up, even if he’s never had complaints in that department.

So take a deep breath and recognize that your flaws are magnified only to you and that you’re desirable. If that’s not enough, learn [how to get over sexual anxiety once and for all](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-get-rid-of-sexual-anxiety). Otherwise, you probably won’t be game to try new things, and you’ll never learn how to be a freak in bed.


有信心

每个人都对自己的性行为感到困扰。也许您担心肚子太圆，或者性交时听起来“不够热”。您的男人可能担心自己的阴茎大小以及是否可以保持阴茎大小，即使他从未在该部门抱怨过。

因此，请深吸一口气，认识到您的缺点只会被您放大，并且您是可取的。如果那还不够，请学习如何一劳永逸地克服性焦虑。否则，您可能不会尝试新事物，也永远不会学会如何卧床不起。

6. Get Out of Your Routine

As we’ve mentioned, a routine isn’t exactly good for a freaky sex life. In fact, some people might consider routine the antithesis of freaky sex. There are no rules about how to get out of a routine. Just make sure you’re having sex at different times and different places.

Try a variety of positions. Chances are you’ll realize how often you have sex in the same way and at the same time, especially if you’ve been having sex with the same person for some time, as you try to break the routine. Sex probably starts in a predictable manner, too. Initiate sex in a different way than you always do, which leads us to our next point.


摆脱常规

正如我们已经提到的那样，例行程序对于怪异的性生活并不完全正确。实际上，有些人可能会认为常规是怪异性的对立面。没有关于如何摆脱常规的规则。只要确保您在不同的时间和不同的地方做爱即可。

尝试各种位置。您可能会发现自己经常以相同的方式和相同的时间做爱，尤其是当您试图打破常规时，与同一个人做爱一段时间了。性也可能以可预见的方式开始。发起性行为的方式与您以往不同，这使我们进入了下一个观点。

7. Initiate Sex

Men often complain that women never initiate sex. This makes them feel less desirable. You probably think your man is super sexy and are worried about how you look or feel, whether he wants sex and not embarrassing yourself. But once you get over all those things and initiate sex, your man will be surprised, and you’ll feel powerful.

发起性爱

男人经常抱怨女人从不发起性行为。这使他们感到不太理想。您可能认为您的男人超级性感，并且担心您的外表或感觉，是否想要做爱而不是让自己尴尬。但是一旦你克服了所有这些事情并开始了性生活，你的男人就会感到惊讶，并且你会感到强大。

5. Sex in Public

Many people who enjoy sex in public are at least a little freaky. There’s something about knowing others can (or could possibly) see or hear you that makes the sex so much hotter.

We do caution against doing anything that could get you arrested and definitely avoid areas where children are! If you’d like to try sex in public with less risk, [discover how to have incredible sex outside.](https://badgirlsbible.com/sex-outside)

6. Threesomes, Swinging and Group Sex

Not every relationship is ideal for adding people, but the right relationships can flourish by increasing the number of people in the bedroom! There are a few things you can consider:

- Swinging is when you swap partners. [Learn more here.](https://badgirlsbible.com/what-is-a-swinger)
- Group sex or orgies involve multiple people.
- Threesomes can be tricky to organize (read more in [this post](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-have-a-threesome) ) but can be well worth it.

Before you attempt any of these situations, you should have a strong relationship. Adding people is not a way to fix your relationship, and you should have a handle on any jealousy.

7. Edging

Edging is a fun and freaky way to have better orgasms. It involves getting yourself or your partner to the brink of orgasm then backing off. You repeat this as long as you’d like (or can!) until you have one explosive orgasm.

8. Phone/Cyber Sex

You might already be familiar with having sex over the phone or computer if you’re in a long-distance relationship.

These two freaky sexy ideas make things hot. Even if you’re in the other room, you can send a steamy message for your man. Or you can leave a voicemail when he’s in the shower. Consider calling him up before you go to bed. Masturbating while he’s on the other end of the line is hot and can even help you sleep better. Adding video via webcam can feel incredibly intimate – and freaky!

10. Spanking

This item on our list of freaky sex ideas is often accompanied by other aspects of BDSM, but it certainly doesn’t have to be. If you’re willing to bare your ass and have it spanked (or to do some spanking yourself), then there are plenty of options to consider.

11. Talk Dirty

Dirty talking is something that makes many people feel anxious, but it can also really enhance the moment. Rest assured that you don’t need to scream “Call me a whore!” (unless you want to, of course).

Instead, you can work your way up by telling your man what feels good, what you’ve been thinking about and missing and what you’d like him to do to you or vice versa.

Now you’ve got plenty of ideas on how to be a freak in bed. Proceed with enthusiasm, but remember that you don’t need to do everything, every time you have sex. In fact, if you try to do it that way, it might seem like you’re completing a checklist rather than enjoying sex.

But if you explore your sexuality with confidence and creativity, both you and your man will benefit from the effort.


 说脏话

肮脏的谈话会让许多人感到焦虑，但它也可以真正改善这一时刻。请放心，您无需大喊“给我叫妓女！” （当然，除非您愿意）。

相反，您可以通过告诉您的男人什么感觉很好，您一直在想什么和想念什么以及您希望他对您做些什么而反之亦然。

现在，您已经有了很多关于如何成为床上怪胎的想法。保持热情，但请记住，每次性交时，您不需要做任何事情。实际上，如果您尝试通过这种方式进行操作，似乎您正在填写清单而不是享受性爱。

但是，如果您以自信和创造力探索自己的性行为，那么您和您的男人都会从这项努力中受益。
