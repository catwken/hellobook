Adding an extra person into your sexual romps has the  potential to create a memory of a lifetime, but it comes with some  potential risks to your relationship. This threesome guide will explain  some of the pitfalls of threesomes and, more importantly, how to have a  threesome you’ll all enjoy.

## Who Wants Threesomes?

When  sex researcher and educator Justin Lehmiller surveyed over 4,000  Americans about their sexual fantasies, multi-partner sex came out on  top [[1](https://books.google.com/books?id=4VruswEACAAJ&dq=tell+me+what+you+want&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi99eO9-ezoAhVK5awKHYydBIgQ6AEwAXoECAAQAg)]  with 87% of women and 95% of men sharing this fantasy. Now, this  category doesn’t just include threesomes, nor does it guarantee that  people want to try it out in reality, but it’s clear that people get off  to the idea of adding at least one person to the bedroom.

As you  can see from these numbers, nearly as many women are into the idea as  men are, so a guy shouldn’t be surprised if his wife wants a threesome.  Although, other studies find that men are much more interested in group  sex threesomes [[2](https://books.google.com/books?id=qaJVAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Plays+Well+in+Groups:+A+Journey+Through+the+World+of+Group+Sex+by+Katherine+Frank+(2013-06-27)&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiI8PLx-uzoAhXMUs0KHfs9BugQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=threesome&f=false) p 7, [3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2019.1580667)] and research finds that men are more likely to have had a threesome than women [[4](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181198)].

Furthermore,  Lehmiller’s research found that older adults were more likely to have  fantasies involving fresh and new people, activities, or locations than  younger adults, and this includes group sex [[1](https://books.google.com/books?id=4VruswEACAAJ&dq=tell+me+what+you+want&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi99eO9-ezoAhVK5awKHYydBIgQ6AEwAXoECAAQAg) p 104]. So, don’t be suprised if you partner of many years, wants to experiment with a threesome.

Both  not everyone wants to have a threesome either. When analyzing peoples’  attachment styles, Lehmiller found that the more people had an insecure  attachment style, the less likely they were to fantasize about group sex  [[1](https://books.google.com/books?id=4VruswEACAAJ&dq=tell+me+what+you+want&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi99eO9-ezoAhVK5awKHYydBIgQ6AEwAXoECAAQAg) p 121]. Finally, the survey revealed, perhaps unsurprisingly, that extraverts were more likely to have group sex fantasies [[1](https://books.google.com/books?id=4VruswEACAAJ&dq=tell+me+what+you+want&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi99eO9-ezoAhVK5awKHYydBIgQ6AEwAXoECAAQAg) p 123].

Again,  this survey asked about fantasies and not activities, but another study  found an association between attitudes, interest, and experience with  threesomes [[5](https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/heterosexual-young-adults-interest-attitudes-and-experiences-rela)].

If  you’re seriously thinking about moving beyond the fantasy and adding a  third person to your bedroom or you’re a single woman who wants some hot  casual sex with two other people, we have threesome advice for you!

## Is Having a Threesome For You?

There  are several reasons why people are turned on by the idea of a 3some.  For starters, you can get to know someone new sexually. You can try  another person’s style without cheating on your lover or spouse. If  you’ve never been with a woman, then a threesome might provide you with  the chance. Similarly, it can be a chance to be with another man if  you’ve only ever been with your partner.

There can be something  particularly erotic for some people about watching their partner with  another person, and a threesome allows this in a safe environment, **especially if you plan it out**. Some people describe this as compersion, which is like the opposite of jealousy.

**Related**: [What Is Compersion?](https://badgirlsbible.com/compersion)

Furthermore,  you get the experience of being watched by a third person as you enjoy  sexual pleasure. If you’re a voyeur or an exhibitionist, a threesome  might feed into your kink.

Finally, we’d be remiss if we forgot to  mention how amazing it can be to experience stimulation from two  directions at once. With just one lover, you can’t experience a tongue  on your clit while kissing your man, but adding a third person to this  mix can provide you with more intense pleasure than ever before, and  you’ve got twice the options to be giving, too!

### When a Threesome is a Bad Idea

Threesomes  aren’t for everyone, however. Don’t force yourself to have one if  you’re not into the idea, no matter how ‘sexy’ it’s supposed to be. A  rocky relationship without good trust and communication is **not**  the foundation for a threesome. A threesome won’t save a struggling  relationship the same way that having a baby doesn’t save a marriage in  dire straits.

Discover how to communicate about sex.](https://badgirlsbible.com/sexual-communication)

Similarly,  having a threesome in an attempt to prevent you or your partner from  cheating is a recipe for failure. Don’t entertain the idea if it’s a  threat or an ultimatum from your partner. Furthermore, no one should ask  their partner for a threesome as part of a “test” of their loyalty.  It’s manipulative and unfair. That sort of behavior isn’t healthy for  you or your relationship.

Sometimes women report going ahead with a  threesome because their husband wants a threesome. There’s a fine line  between being game and agreeing to something that will only breed  resentment and distance between you and your partner. Keeping quiet  might seem like a way to keep the peace, but it might also be the exact  opposite of what you should do.

Although you might not get to have  a threesome and you or your partner might be disappointed, you might  also find that your partner is on the same page as you, and you can work  on trust and communication until you are ready for it.

Remember  that if the reality is daunting, you can always stick to fantasy land.  Read erotica to your partner or work the mention of a third person into  your dirty talk. [More on dirty talk here](https://badgirlsbible.com/dirty-talk-phrases).

Here’s  a fun option that doesn’t require you to leave the house: try swapping  photos or videos with a third person. All three of you can get on the  phone or cam and enjoy sex that way, too.

Discover the [4 rules for hot phone sex](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-have-phone-sex).

On the other hand, a threesome might be your idea. If your partner is willing, why not give it a go?

## Finding Your Perfect Partners

Even if you’re sure you want a it, you shouldn’t rush head-first into it without understanding how to have a threesome.

**MMF or FFM? –**  Do you want to add another man or woman into your bedroom? MMF (male  male female) triangles include two men, as the acronym suggests, but  your partner may be more comfortable with an FFM (female female male)  situation, which is sometimes percieved as the less stigmatized gender  arrangement for threesomes [[6](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1363460708091743), [7](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2018.1546766), [8](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1363460716678562)], and women may more frequently engage in FFM threesomes [[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26028062)].

The next question is who will be part of the threesome…

**Choose the third person wisely –**  For a couple in a relationship,  you only need to find a third person,  but being single doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy a threesome! You’ll  just have to look for two willing folks.  In fact, one survey found that  people were more likely to have a threesome with an FWB than a romantic  partner [[10](https://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2017/12/20/experiences-with-bdsm-and-group-sex-among-friends-with-benefits-and-romantic-partners)].  You might become the perfect third for another couple, or none of you might be in a relationship together.

If  one partner feels a little trepidation over the idea of a threesome,  they might be reassured by having control over certain aspects, such as  choosing the third person or location/setting and controlling what  happens during the interaction (more on that in a bit).

**Friend or stranger? –**  There are typically two schools of thought when it comes to inviting  someone into a threesome. You can go with a friend whom you trust and  are attracted to because it’s safer… Or you can opt for a stranger who  you won’t have to see afterward if you know won’t be able to continue  being friends with a person after you’ve seen them naked! Plus, you  don’t have to talk to a stranger again if your threesome doesn’t work  out so well.

Furthermore, it can be hard to tell whether a friend  would be open to the idea of joining you in a threesome. If you know a  friend who has expressed attraction to you and/or your partner or  interest in being part of a threesome, it can make approaching the  subject much easier, but you could be risking your entire friendship if  someone is offended by the question.

However, if you think a  friend might be down and are unsure how to initiate a threesome, a close  night at home with some alcohol might make things happen spontaneously.

Although  you and your partner may have thought of someone you wanted to invite  into your bed for a few hours, you might not immediately know who you  want to try a threesome with. It can help to ensure that you have a good  time if you choose someone who has some experience with threesomes and  might even have their own threesome techniques.

Many couples look  for a bisexual man or woman, and this can be ideal. Beware that some  bisexual women are especially turned off by couples who are searching  for their “unicorn” as it can be objectifying.

**Find your threesome partner online –**  Thanks to the Internet, finding a person or two to join in your  threesome is easier than ever. You can post on Craigslist, meet people  with the Tinder app or start an OkCupid or POF profile where you  describe what and who it is that you want. Niche sites like FetLife and  adult personals including AdultFriendFinder can also lead you to someone  to join in your threesome, enabling you to find a match and initiate a  threesome. Some people have set up their threesome through swinger  websites or groups.

**Read More:** [What Is a Swinger?](https://badgirlsbible.com/what-is-a-swinger)

**But remember…**

Just  because someone is interested doesn’t mean they’re a good fit. Not only  do you have to consider chemistry between yourself and another person,  but you also have to consider how the other two people will get along.  Plus, there are issues of whether you’re all attracted to each other,  kinks and sexual interests and even a person’s STI status can send you  back to square one when looking for someone to have a threesome with.

If  you don’t know or can’t find someone to join you and your partner,  there is one final option: a sex worker. Knowing that this person is  paid can minimize any potential insecurities. Furthermore, sex workers  are experienced at navigating boundaries and helping put people at ease.  If you live in a location where sex work is legal, this just might be  the best option. Make it clear that you want a threesome, however, as  not all sex workers might provide this service and some might charge  more for it.

## How to Have a Threesome Without Hurt Feelings

Adding  another person into a dynamic, even if it’s only for temporary sexual  pleasure, adds a lot more emotions. You might be surprised by how you  feel. Some people find themselves feeling jealous of insecure during or  after a threesome, which throws them off their game because they were  the ones you introduced the topic in the first place! Sometimes, the  partner who wasn’t the one who brought up the idea of a threesome might  become the one who enjoys it more.

All of these feelings are  normal, and they don’t have to be detrimental to your existing  relationship if you communicate them effectively. For starters, it can  be helpful if you talk to your lover about the potential feelings you’ll  have before the fact. Recognize that you may have negative or even  positive emotions that seem outside of your control. The two of you  might even talk about how you would react to the other person’s  feelings.

Even if you inferred a threesome, you might struggle  with guilt because of what society teaches us about sex. Sometimes  someone may not realize that guilt is acting up or project their  feelings on their partner.

During these discussions, you should  set some ground rules. You can even include the third person to ensure  that everyone is comfortable and will abide by those rules.

## Common Ground Rules

- No kissing between non-romantic partners.
- No intercourse/penetration between non-romantic partners.
- Meet in public first.
- Share STI results.
- Use protection — check if your new addition might [have a latex allergy](https://badgirlsbible.com/condom-allergy).
- Specify a word if things are not going well, similar to [a safe word](https://badgirlsbible.com/bdsm-rules) in BDSM.
- The third person cannot spend the night.

Remember that your third person is still a person, so treat them as more than just an activity or novelty [[11](https://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/how_do_i_get_my_girlfriend_comfortable_with_the_idea_of_a_threesome)]!

After  these discussions, the action can begin! One thing to consider is  whether you know both of the people in the room but they don’t know each  other well (or vice versa). It can be helpful for the people who aren’t  well acquainted to have a bit of alone time to fix that, so consider  fixing a drink.

Speaking of drinking, a bit of social lubricant  may help ease any jitters for everyone. A threesome can feel a bit  nerve-wracking like a first date!

**Talk, don’t assume –**  It’s just as important to communicate during your session. You should  check in with your partner about whether or not he likes something  you’re doing. When you get to know a new partner, the same tactic  applies, and it can help you navigate the new feelings you may have  during your first threesome.

**When to stop –** One  thing you should be prepared for is that your partner may want you to  stop. It may come as a direct, spoken request, or you may simply notice  that one of the others in your threesome seems reserved. If one or both  of you wants to stop, **you should do so immediately**.

This  is a great time to check in. Sometimes the emotions can become so  intense that someone experiences a panic attack or begins crying. At  this point, communication, and care take precedence over any benefit you  might receive from a threesome. However, a pause can help you to  regroup and discuss your feelings before continuing.

Asking if you  can continue to the next step — moving to the bedroom or bed, taking  off clothing, or touching a certain body part is a great way to get  consent whether you’re having a threesome or just with another person.  If two people are a couple, the third might consider asking the one  partner if it’s okay to touch the other.

It can be difficult to  track what every person is doing, but any time two people focus  specifically on each other, the third can feel left out or not know what  to do in a threesome. Threesome tip: angle your bodies so that everyone  can make eye contact with at least one other person. This leads us to  our next point.

## The Best Threesome Positions

Hopefully, by now, you know how to have a three way and you’re excited to undress.

It  can be overwhelming to add an extra body to the bedroom, but planning a  threesome and knowing what you’re doing will make things much, much  easier. Let’s start with some threesome positions

Threesome ideas  will vary based on whether you’ve set up an MMF or an FFM threesome and  whatever ground rules you set. Obviously, if two men (or women) do not  wish to touch, you’ll want to choose positions to accommodate them  during three way sex.

If you’re in an MMF three way, try these positions:

- **Double penetration –**  One partner penetrates you vaginally while the other penetrates you  anally. You can start this with one male partner lying down on his back  and you in the cowgirl position ([see it here](https://badgirlsbible.com/cowgirl-sex-position)), then the other partner penetrates you from behind like in doggy style ([see it demonstrated here](https://badgirlsbible.com/doggy-style-sex-position))
- **Eiffel Tower –**  This silly name can mean serious fun. In this threesome position,  you’ll be giving one partner a blow job while being penetrated by the  other person. The Eiffel Tower gets its name from the way it looks from  the side when you’re on all fours.
- **Missionary –** With one man between your legs in regular missionary position ([see it demonstrated here](https://badgirlsbible.com/missionary-sex-position)), the other can kneel by your head, where you can give oral ministrations to his cock and balls ([more oral sex tips here](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-give-a-blowjob)).
- **Edge play –** Lie down with your neck at the edge of the bed exactly like in [this photo](https://badgirlsbible.com/lie-back-blow-job-position). One man penetrates you vaginally or anally, while the other positions himself so that you can provide oral.

What about threesomes with two women and one man?

- **Dual ride –** One of you sits on his face while the other rides his cock.
- **61+1 –** Get into 69 position with the other woman ([you can learn about it and see it demonstrated here](https://badgirlsbible.com/69-sex-position)). The man then penetrates one of you. It’s typically easier for him to take one woman in doggy position ([learn more about doggy style here](https://badgirlsbible.com/doggy-style-sex-position)), but with the right tweaks, he can move into a kneeling position to have sex with the woman on the bottom.
- **Sail away –**  The man penetrates you with your legs over his shoulders. The other  woman straddles you for oral sex. The man and woman can kiss if  comfortable, and she can reach down to play with your nipples.
- **Rowboat –**  The man lies down on his back with you straddling his face. The other  woman rides him cowgirl, which keeps her hands free to wrap around you  and fondle your breasts or scratch your back.

Some threesome  positions work well no matter the gender. Form a circle so that each  person is having their genitals licked and sucked by someone’s mouth,  lips and tongue, and everyone is sure to have a mind-blowing time! It’s  always fun for two parties to go down on the other, too. If one person  in your three way likes to rim, he or she can take up position behind a  free rear end and get licking!

There are always variations of these positions too.

For  example, your male partners may desire to stroke or suck each other,  and two people in your triangle may be turned on by the idea of  analingus ([read the guide on anilingus here](https://badgirlsbible.com/anilingus-guide-aka-rimming-aka-tossing-the-salad)).  As long as everyone is involved and feeling good, don’t worry about  whether you’re in the “right” threesome position! For instance, one of  you might enjoy masturbating while watching the others have sex, or you  might be able to get off while fingering yourself ([tips here](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-finger-yourself)) and making out with one partner. If someone has a free hand, mouth or genitals, take this opportunity to get to work.

## Safer Sex and Threesomes

Whenever  you have sex with someone new, it’s important to check their STI  status, and having a threesome is no exception. If everyone produces a  clean bill of health, you can feel great about having sex. Using condoms  can reduce the risk of transmission, but STIs such as HPV that are  transmitted through the skin [[12](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/hpv)] are risky no matter what.

Click here to learn the [symptoms of STIs in women](https://badgirlsbible.com/sti-symptoms).

Because  some STIs have no symptoms, it’s important to get screened after each  new partner. It’s also okay to ask potential partners to see their  screening results or even to get tested together.

[Discover how to use a condom](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-use-a-condom).

Condoms  also prevent accidental pregnancy, of course, and any women involved in  the threesome may want to disclose what type of birth control they use  if any.

Finally, **no finger, tongue or penis should move from an anus to a vagina or mouth**.  Although “ass to mouth” might be common in porn, the bacteria found in  the anus is harmful to other orifices and lead to a bacterial infection [known as bacterial vaginosis](https://badgirlsbible.com/bacterial-vaginosis-causes-symptoms-treatments), which can even make you more likely to contract other infections, including HIV [[13](http://www.idph.state.il.us/public/hb/hbbv.htm), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3788616/), [15](https://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/fact-sheets/sexually-transmitted-diseases/bacterial-vaginosis/index.html)].  Switching condoms between orifices is a good way to reduce this.

## After a Threesome

So  your threesome is over, now what? You and your partner can talk about  how it went, what worked, and what didn’t. Perhaps you want to explore  more threesomes, maybe even with the same person!

**The danger –**  Sometimes, a threesome can bring up feelings you never anticipated,  perhaps even leading to a breakup if you ignored the best way to have a  threesome (communicate, trust, respect). Someone might have felt left  out or even bored if you didn’t use the right threesome techniques to  keep everyone involved.

**Jealousy –** Jealousy can pop up in the middle of your threesome [[16](https://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/how_do_i_talk_about_my_interest_in_a_threesome_with_my_boyfriend), [17](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13691058.2018.1453088)].  It’s not uncommon for women to compare themselves to a new woman in the  bedroom and men to men. Breast or penis size and body shape/size are  common comparisons. If you already feel insecure about your appearance  or sexual performance, bringing someone new into the bedroom can  exacerbate those insecurities.

This is why you only want to bring  in other sexual partners when your relationship is strong and built  mutual on trust and respect. If a romantic or sexual relationship  continues between two of the people (i.e. cheating), then the  relationship is rocky. If one person pushes for more threesomes when the  other would rather not, the relationship may not survive, either.

Relationships can get over negative feelings with a lot of communication, prioritizing one another, and respecting boundaries.

**After the threesome –**  It can help to reaffirm your relationship with your partner by cuddling  or doing something special just husband and wife. Schedule a romantic  date soon after the threesome. Plan activities that remind you of the  connection you share.

If this sounds a bit like [aftercare in BDSM,](https://badgirlsbible.com/bdsm-aftercare) it’s similar, except it helps your relationship return to equilibrium.

Of  course, it may very well be that everyone has a good time, and there  are no hurt feelings, but you can never be sure how you’ll feel after a  threesome, especially your first.

For some couples, having a threesome can revitalize their sex lives. However…

**There are potential downsides –** Rushing  into a threesome haphazardly can also ruin your relationship, lead to  pregnancy or spread infections. Make sure you’re emotionally, mentally  and logistically prepared, and recognize that no matter how much you  might want a threesome, it might not be amazing. On the other hand,  having a threesome could open up doors to a new sexual world. You never  know unless you try!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### FAQ #1 – Why do some people desire threesomes?

There’s  no easy way to answer why some people are interested in particular  sexual activities and others aren’t. When it comes to threesomes, it may  be a way of experiencing novelty even when you’re in a relationship. In  fact, we may even be programmed to seek out novelty. It’s known as the  Coolidge Effect [[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28912031), [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902417)].

A  threesome allows someone to experiment with a person of the same  gender. Breaking cultural norms can also be thrilling. And many people  enjoy the idea of having two people focusing sexual attention on  themselves at once. Of course, there may be other reasons why people  like threesomes. Every person is unique.

With that said, not everyone is into threesomes, and some people prefer the fantasy of multi-partner sex to the reality.

### FAQ #2 – Does wanting a threesome say something about my commitment?

Again,  this varies. Some people enjoy how new experiences bring them closer to  their partner, and a threesome may increase pleasure and understanding [[20](https://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/ménage-à-trois-0)]. Only you know if you still feel committed to your partner — and vice versa.

There  may be people who are specifically interested in another person and use  a threesome as a way to have sex with them, and the request for a  threesome way be a way to test or manipulate a partner, but just wanting  a threesome isn’t necessarily negative.

### FAQ #3 – Why do I feel bad about a threesome, even if it was my idea?

Threesomes  are exciting, but we live in a world where we are often taught to be  romantically and sexually monogamous. Sharing a romantic partner and  being vulnerable with a new person may be too much for some. No  threesome tips can fully prepare for this. You can’t really know until  you try.

While you cannot control your feelings, you can control  your behaviors in response to them. You can work through negative  feelings with your partner or the help of a professional if you need to.

### FAQ #4 – How do I make sure a threesome goes well?

Planning  a threesome is all about communication. Choosing the right people,  setting ground rules, respecting boundaries, and communicating with your  partner and third person all ensure you’ll be more likely to have a  successful threesome. Furthermore, make sure the threesome is something  both you and your partner really want to do.

### FAQ #5 – What if my partner is coercing me into a threesome I don’t want?

You  should only participate in sexual situations that you agree to. If your  partner is trying to coerce you to have a threesome or do anything else  you have no interest in, it might be time to consider if you want to be  with someone who doesn’t respect you.

### FAQ #6 –  What are some common threesome rules?

Rules  can include no kissing between non-romantic partners, always using  protection, and no intercourse between non-romantic partners. However,  you can set any rules you’d like.

### FAQ #7 – What if I want another threesome and my partner doesn’t?

You  must respect your partner’s boundaries. If you cannot and want to  continue having sex with someone or have more threesomes, it might be  time to consider whether you are compatible.

   Your  wife no matter what, must be sure that you still appreciate her and  respect her as until now.especially for something like this you have to  prepare mentally your partners, that your partner is secure in his  challenging and attractive towards you, that you love your partner and  you want to enjoy him (her) in such an act. that your partner is sure of  her (his) importance for decision after such sex for or against further  continuation of such satisfaction. do not let that something like that  disturb your freedom of further conversations and safety in your life  and love. don’t trust anybody as your spouse.

   So  I’m a 26 year old male. Just lost my virginity last night to a hot 37  year old full figured woman(hopefully she just thought I was  inexperienced)Hopefully she never reads this) We were watching some hulu  exclusive show I forgot the name. The episode was called devils  threesome. Naturally it opened up the dialogue, I asked if she was into  it or ever tried it. She said she didn’t try but when she watches porn  two men are better than one. I mentioned that I would actually be into  trying it as long as all the attention was on the female. We got to it,  after I absolutely disappointed her. I thought I was gonna be able swap  condoms after busting and keep going. I stay hard after I jerk off why  wouldn’t I getting laid? I was so wrong. It was like…I was totally  drained of sexual energy, on some mystical sort of level. It was  lifeless for an hour and a half after the fact. Anyways…..This evening I  texted her that I was sorry, explained myself and my thought process.  Told her I thought she was super hot and her body was amazing(all true)  it’s been a while(semi true)and I just couldn’t help myself. “I would  love to meet up again, I know I was nervous and timid and not as good as  porn and your vibrator so I’m gonna leave it up to you. If you don’t  feel like meeting up with new people and risk them being dangerous or  creepy feel free to get in touch ;)” (I met her on one of those swipe  happy dating/hook up apps) She said okay with a smiley face. Then I said  “I know this probably isn’t very appropriate but if you were serious  about the thought of being with two men I might know someone who would  be down” I had spoken to a friend of mine a few days before this. He  told me his buddy and his gf invited him to join them, that he had done  it before etc. etc. I told him I would honestly be down to try it, you  only live once might as well get the most out of life right? She texted  me around midnight, I think she might have gotten a little buzzed,  started watching porn, got a bit horney and put some serious thought  into what I mentioned to her, cuz she texted me asking about my friend.  I’m pretty sure she wouldn’t give me the light of day after my terrible  performance, so at the risk of her using him as a booty call after using  me as a means to a threesome end I’m working on setting it up.  Hopefully my member is nicer than his. I’m gonna go out of my way to  make sure I’m the last one hard in my room. Just to be sure she uses me  as a booty call instead of him haha. I know it sounds sexist and grimey.  I’m really not that kind of guy. If I was a few years older I would  honestly take this woman out to dinner, give her a kiss goodnight and go  home, I honestly think she deserves it.

   Anyway this article  really helped me out. I love porn but I try not to watch the crazy  stuff. I have a feeling some things only happen in porn. I don’t wanna  get any crazy ideas, unless it’s analingus. Thats cool, hopefully she  likes buttstuff, gonna make it a point to ask.

   I  will never in my life get why people like threesomes. All it does is  add an annoying person into the mix, and it normally ends with someone  being left out and depressed

   The panic attack and crying bit was  the most realistic, but it happens when the rejected garbage person is  in the other room because they snuck out

     If  it works, it REALLY FUCKING WORKS. You just need to communicate a LOT.  I’m currently in Seattle, day 5 of a week-long sex marathon my friend J.  and her boyfriend E. flew me across the country for.

     My first threesome, and it’s awesome!

     It’s  best when all three people are into each other. J just ate me out like a  champ, and got me ready to ride E, while she licked his balls. When he  recovers, she’s gonna take my ass with a strapon while I take his cock.

     The  thing is, I’ve know and been comfortable with J for ten years, and we  have always shared a mutual attraction. E and I have been flirting  online for months and months. When I got here, we just all fit together,  but it took a lot of communication and constant “is this OK?” checkins.  I would never try this with two people I didn’t implicitly trust.

     (Also,  all three of us have backgrounds in kink, so we have experience with  communication, safewords, and being ok with saying and respecting “no” )

   I’ve  had threesums withs others I personally knew first and they were the  best. Depends on the person because my other friend did the same and  ruined a 6 year relationship from jealousy. I suggest the girl picks  who, and take it the extra strep by leaving the house a half hour while  your girl gets the invited guests into the mood buy being dressed  sexywhen she wants in and even complementing and taking the other guests  clothes off to find a sexy outfit like herself. Let your girl practice  some small toys and have you walk in eventually to join in and pull out  the heavier ammo of adult game pieces xo

     You should have a threesome IF you want it. If you don’t then it’s not going to be a positive experience for you.

   LOVE  a threesome but agree that communication is so important. Get ground  rules out of the way before you get naked. Talk a lot while you play to  make sure everyone is enjoying and feeling included. Debrief afterwords  to figure out what worked and what didnt. I play with married couples  and always make sure the wife is ok with hubby penetetrating me.

   My  boyfriend and I have talked about having a threesome for sooo long now,  I’m dying to have one with another girl, but i don’t know where to meet  people for that, I don’t really feel comfortable with meeting someone  random and not knowing their STI status, or knowing them personally and  we’re not attracted to any of our friends. How can we meet someone and  get to know them for this purpose ? any suggestions?

     Why not make a tinder profile of you and your boyfriend?

   Why  would anyone be happy about their partner coming to them and announcing  that they want to sleep with someone else and want you to be a part of  it and enjoy it? It’s just cheating without it technically being  cheating. You don’t get the label of asshole because it’s a fantasy  instead.

   I often imagine playing with two men.

   Also, I always want to dress nicely for them.

   I also want to be seen as always stimulating to young men.

   They’re secretly looking at my legs and it’s too stimulating to observe my body.

   I want to dress up for them all the time and make them excited to see me
