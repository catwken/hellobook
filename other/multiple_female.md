In  the sex world, multiple orgasms are something like a unicorn. Women who  can have them experience intense pleasure, but those who haven’t quite  learned how to have multiple orgasms are sometimes skeptical that it’s  even possible. Fortunately, this may be a skill that you’re able to  learn, and we have some tips for you.

What  is a multiple orgasm exactly? It depends on the woman. It may mean  multiple orgasms in a single session or being able to quickly achieve  orgasms. For example, you might consider yourself multi orgasmic if you  can have more than one orgasm in a five or ten minute period. These may  be called successive orgasms as well [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695750/#B1)].

For some women, having multiple orgasms means having a series of orgasms in quick succession.

It’s  often more difficult for a woman to have one orgasm let alone learning  how to have multiple orgasms. If you’re only focused on the end game,  you can miss out on a lot of pleasure along the way. Furthermore,  focusing on achieving one or more orgasms can be the very reason why a  woman isn’t able to have one.

Focus on pleasure versus orgasm, so even if you don’t have multiple orgasms, you’ve still had a good time.

Make  sure you have enough time for multiple orgasms. This means you’ll also  have to change your attitude (changing your attitude is often necessary  if you want to [improve your sex life](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-improve-your-sex-life)).  If you expect that a sexual romp ends with your orgasm – or with his –  you’ll have to be prepared to spend some time on you after he finishes  or focus on your pleasure before the big finale.

In fact, foreplay might be even more important when it comes to having multiple orgasms than with your traditional quickie sex!

[Read more about quickies](https://badgirlsbible.com/quickie).

This  means you might want to hold off on going for multiples with a  brand-new partner if you’re not completely comfortable. Women are more  likely to have orgasms in committed relationships [[2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122412445802)]. If you struggle to orgasm with a new partner, then having more than one won’t be an easy feat.

Being able to communicate about sex can increase your chances of having an orgasm [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087699/)]. So, if you’re struggling to orgasm or multiple orgasms, make sure you work on your sexual communication.

You  can set the mood with music, candles or incense and lighting that makes  you feel comfortable. Then, get your partner get to work on your clit  with his tongue or your favorite toy. We’ve got some great [advice when it comes to foreplay](https://badgirlsbible.com/foreplay-tips) in this post.

## Before You Orgasm Twice, Learn to Orgasm Once

Some  women who want to know how to orgasm more than once haven’t quite  achieved a single orgasm. It’s best to start with one and work your way  up.

[Find out how to orgasm every time](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-orgasm).

If you want to know the highlights, here they are:

- More women orgasm from clitoral stimulation alone when compared to using only vaginal stimulation [[4](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2017.1346530)]; and many prefer clitoral stimulation it even if they don’t *need* it.
- Penetrative sex often isn’t enough to give a woman an orgasm [[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29537732), [6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022399981900994?via%3Dihub)]. It will be harder the further your clitoris from your vaginal opening [[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3894744/)].
- Manual and oral stimulation are fantastic for clitoral orgasm as are sex toys.
- Positions such as [Thigh Tide](https://badgirlsbible.com/thigh-tide-sex-position) or [Coital Alignment Technique](https://badgirlsbible.com/coital-alignment-technique-sex-position) can help you orgasm during penetration.
- It’s usually easier to master orgasm by yourself, not with a partner. [Check out this guide to masturbating](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-masturbate-for-women) for more information.

## Mastering Different Types Of Orgasms Is Key to Having Multiple Orgasms

Variety  is often key when it comes to women achieving multiple orgasms. If  you’re like many women, your clitoris might become very sensitive after  having an orgasm. This is totally normal, and you may need to back off  or tell your partner to give you some space while your body recuperates.

In men, this is known as the refractory period, and it makes arousal and further orgasm difficult [[8](https://www.issm.info/sexual-health-qa/what-is-the-refractory-period/), [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19515210), [10](https://opentext.wsu.edu/psych105/chapter/9-4-sexual-behavior/)]. It can vary widely [[11](https://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/stages-male-sexual-response)] — from minutes to over a day.

As  a woman, however, you may be able to achieve more than one type of  orgasm because you have a shorter refractory period — or none at all [[12](http://www.austincc.edu/dgran/Sexual Arousal.pdf), [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4539874/)]. This means you might have a vaginal/G-spot orgasm ([more about vaginal orgasms here](https://badgirlsbible.com/vaginal-orgasm))  while your clit is sensitive. A stream of varied orgasms sounds pretty  good to us! You should first get used to stimulation that can help build  the various types of orgasms, however.

Schoolboys might joke  about not being able to find the clitoris, but many women are already  familiar with clitoral orgasms, which you can [read all about in this post](https://badgirlsbible.com/clitoral-stimulation).  The fleshy nub above your vaginal opening is home to thousands of nerve  endings, which means it readily responds to stimulation from fingers,  tongues, and vibrators.

Speaking of vibrators, your trusty toy may  be just what you need to experience a multiple orgasm. Some women find  it much easier to orgasm when using a toy. It can bring you to orgasm  more quickly and reduce strain on your hand and fingers.

There’s  another advantage when it comes to multiple orgasms. If you find it  harder to orgasm a second or third time, a sex toy can make it easier.

Check out our [sex toy recommendations.](https://badgirlsbible.com/best-sex-toys)

You  might even enjoy having your partner rub his penis against your clit!  Clitoral orgasms are often described as being more shallow than the  other types. You may not feel this type of orgasm as deeply, or it might  not last as long, but that doesn’t mean it’s not fun!

Remember, according to Dr. Emily Nagoski,

> there is no “right” or “better” kind of orgasm [[14](https://books.google.com/books?id=i6Z-BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=come+as+you+are&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidpaaU1YHZAhVK11MKHdz0A7wQ6AEIKTAA#v=snippet&q=orgasm&f=false) p 271]

### G-spot Orgasms

If  you’re one of the lucky women who can experience G-spot orgasms, you  may also be able to squirt, which will add another element of fun when  you’re having multiple orgasms! The G-spot is a location on the front  wall of the vagina behind your pubic bone that’s particularly sensitive.  This is a spot where you can actually access your clitoris internally.  The glans of the clitoris that you see is just part of a larger organ  that extends inside your body [[15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ca.22177)].

Curled fingers or sex toys can often reach this spot even if your partner’s penis misses it during traditional sex.

Get the lowdown on [squirting](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-make-yourself-squirt).

Your  G-spot may respond to vibrations, but the G-spot often needs firm  pressure to achieve orgasm. Learn more about G-spot orgasms in [this guide](https://badgirlsbible.com/masturbation-techniques).

### A-spot Orgasms

There’s  another sensitive spot inside the vagina, however. The A-spot,  sometimes known as the anterior fornix, is located on the front wall of  the vagina near the cervix. Unlike the clitoris, the A-spot doesn’t  become super sensitive after orgasm, which makes it a great tool when  you’re learning how to have multiple orgasms.

### Anal Orgasms

Anal  orgasms tend to be less common, and they occur with anal stimulation  alone. If you’re one of the lucky women who can cum from anal  penetration or stimulation – it doesn’t need to include insertion if  you’re not comfortable! – then you can add this, so your repertoire to  experience a multiple orgasm for the first time. Click here to [learn how to improve anal sex](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-have-anal-sex).

If  you’re on the receiving end of multiple types of stimulation, you might  experience a blended orgasm that displays characteristics from multiple  types of orgasms. As long as you enjoy your orgasms, don’t fret too  much about their origin and classification!

## What Else Can You Do?

Rest  assured that there are a few things you can do if you’re having trouble  with multiple orgasms. For starters, improving your pelvic floor  muscles, also known as PC muscles, can help you have orgasms more easily  and achieve more intense orgasms. To locate your PC muscles, imagine  that you’re squeezing those muscles near your bladder to cut off the  flow of urine.

The muscles in back should remain still as you do  this. These handy little exercises can be done while waiting in line at  the store of folding laundry.

These exercises are called Kegels,  after the doctor who first developed them for women, especially mothers,  who experienced urinary incontinence. You can do Kegels on your own or  invest in kegel strengthening devices.

Typically, these take the  form of kegel balls like the Luna Beads by Lelo, but you can also clench  and release muscles around a dildo or other weighted toy to strengthen  your muscles for a count of three. It’s important not just to clench  your PC muscles but to release them as well.

It’s easy to fit  kegel exercises into your routine, and you and your partner can both  notice benefits even if it doesn’t help you achieve multiple orgasm.  Your partner can feel you clench your PC muscles during sex when they’re  strong, and clenching and relaxing as your orgasm approaches can be far  more intense.

Now,  we’ve focused on everything you can do to achieve multiple orgasms so  this next piece of advice might seem counterintuitive: slow down.  Obviously, you may need to wait for your body’s own refractory period,  but the process of building up to an orgasm can take a lot out of you,  both physically and mentally.

You might just need to give your  clit a little break before you return to stimulating it. Use this time  to stimulate your man (how about a handjob or blowjob?), kiss  passionately, run your hands over each other’s bodies, or simply cuddly  closely.

Click here for a reminder of how [cuddling rocks for intimacy](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-cuddle)! Enjoy some ice cream in bed or list everything that turns you on about your partner.

This  both helps you to focus on being in the moment rather than your goal of  multiple orgasms. Plus, you can build intimacy with your partner, enjoy  some downtime and use naughty talk or intimate touches to get back into  the swing of things. Your man might even be ready for another go  ’round, too, which is perfect for having multiple orgasms!

## Men and Multiple Orgasms

Although  you’re probably reading this because you asked “Can women have multiple  orgasms?”, it’s possible for men to experience this, too! Check out the  resources section for some books that can help you and your partner  explore multiple orgasms together.

Women who discover they’re able  to achieve multiple orgasms can open doors that expand their sexuality,  and you should have fun trying. But if multiples aren’t within your  grasp, it’s completely okay. Remember that it’s always better to enjoy  the journey than the destination. This might be the key to discovering  how to have multiple orgasms.

## What The Science Says

You  can’t understand what makes a woman multi orgasmic without understanding  exactly what an orgasm is. Don’t worry; we’ll make sure this is easy to  understand. You can think of orgasm as

> the sudden  discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the sexual response  cycle, resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region  characterized by sexual pleasure [[16](https://www.macalester.edu/projects/UBNRP/Website_Orgasm_Neuroscience/What_is_an_orgasm.html)].

The built-up tension releases, your muscles contract [[17](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/topics/orgasms), [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17186125)], and you generally feel pleasure when you have an orgasm [[19](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/health/services/promotion/sexual-health-sex-101/orgasm)]. Some people regard orgasm as an ecstatic state [[20](https://kiweb.iu.edu/pdf/womens orgasm annual review.pdf)]. You can feel your heart rate increasing [[21](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00849751)].

There are things going on when you orgasm that you can’t directly sense, including the release of hormones such as prolactin [[22](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00345-004-0496-7)] and serotonin [[23](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11930-008-0025-6)], which lifts your mood, improves memory, and can even help you sleep better [[24](https://teens.drugabuse.gov/blog/post/word-day-serotonin)]. It may also contributes to your guy’s refractory period [[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4896089/)].

Another reason orgasm feels so good? It releases endorphins, which also release with exercise to make you feel good [[26](https://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/orgasms-and-endorphins)]. Oxytocin is released during orgasm [[27](https://putslab.la.psu.edu/documents/Wheatley - Puts 2015 Shackeford - Hansen.pdf)], and it can promote bonding.

All  of this activity shows up in brain scans called scans. Researchers use  fMRIs to image womens’ brains during orgasm and found that activity  increases leading up to and during orgasm in the nucleus accumbens,  insula, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, operculum,  right angular gyrus, paracentral lobule, cerebellum, hippocampus,  amygdala, hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and dorsal raphe, which  are the sensory, motor, reward, frontal cortical, and brainstem regions [[28](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(17)31396-6/fulltext)].

A woman’s ability to have *multiple* orgasms is due to how her body experiences desire, and research has helped us understand that better.

You’re  probably been taught that arousal works like this: excitement, plateau,  orgasm, and, finally, resolution. This linear model was proposed by sex  researchers Masters and Johnson [[29](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/sexual-response-cycle), [30](http://www.midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1524.pdf), [31](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/009262300278641)]. As it turns out, it’s pretty much what happens for men. They’re aroused, they orgasm, and they’re done.

But the arousal cycle for women may differ from that linear model [[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC557105/)]. For starters, it doesn’t even consider desire [[33](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1018.7723&rep=rep1&type=pdf)].

Wanna know other ways that men and women differ? Read this [article about sexual desire.](https://badgirlsbible.com/sexual-desire)

Alternative models have been proposed for women, including those that have multiple peaks — orgasms [[34](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029784401014521), [29](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/sexual-response-cycle), [35](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2002.01002.x)]. A woman’s arousal decreases much more slowly after orgasm. When you’re still in a heightened state of arousal, (during which [you’ll experience clitoral erection](https://badgirlsbible.com/clitoral-erection)) it can be easier to have a second orgasm.. and perhaps more!

Understanding  your arousal cycle isn’t just useful when you want to know how to  achieve multiple orgasms; it’s also great for getting yourself horny.

Because women are able to return to arousal and have multiple orgasms, a circular model has also been suggested [[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18086161), [37](https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)31168-1/fulltext)].

In short, it’s easier to be multi orgasmic because you’re not going back to square one immediately after you orgasm once.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### FAQ #1 – Is every woman capable of multiple orgasms?

We’d  be remiss to say “Yes.” Most women possess the potential just like most  women can squirt. One study found that 42.7% of participants could have  multiple orgasms [[38](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-16300-001)].

However,  it may not be possible for any number of reasons. Some women are simply  “one and done” when it comes to orgasms — like most men. This doesn’t  make you inadequate, however [[39](https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book-excerpts/health-article/all-about-orgasms/)].

Before  you write off the possibility, however, you should learn more about  your arousal cycle and your body’s preferences. Greater knowledge may be  able to be used in “sexual activities to obtain more effective  stimulation for fuller use of […]sexual capacity [[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8124735)].”

### FAQ #2 – Can men have multiple orgasms?

Yes!  It’s entirely possible for a man to experience the joy of multiple  orgasms. Unlike women, who typically have the same type of orgasm  multiple times, men must master “dry” orgasms, which are typically  achieved through prostate stimulation.

[Learn more about prostate play.](https://badgirlsbible.com/prostate-massage)

If your man can hold back his ejaculation, he may be able to have multiple orgasms, too [[41](https://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/multiple-orgasms-—-possible), [42](http://heart.sdsu.edu/~website/Biology_307/Lectures/pdfs/10_sex_response.pdf)]!

### FAQ #3 – Is there a surefire way to have multiple orgasms?

Sadly,  not. If you try to keep your arousal up, pause briefly after orgasm if  your clitoris becomes overstimulated, but continue stimulation, you’ll  have better chances. It’s important to listen to your body, however.

### FAQ #4 – Is it normal if my first orgasm is the strongest?

Yes! The intensity of orgasms can vary. One study found that “contractions were more prominent during the initial orgasms [[43](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498209551144)].”
