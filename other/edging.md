Orgasm  but NOT letting yourself cum yet. Repeat that process as many times as  you can stand before you finally let yourself have an orgasm. It will  make your resulting orgasm feel a lot more powerful and intense.

Edging is sometimes known as orgasm control when it’s done by your partner with the intent to control when you cum.

The bottom line…

You can edge solo when masturbating alone or…

You can can edge your partner. Equally, your partner can edge you.

Let’s jump into the details…

## Why would you want to learn how to edge yourself?

Easy.

As I mentioned previously

**Edging can produce more powerful orgasms, even those that you might call “explosive.”**

Additionally…

Orgasm  control at your partner’s hands allows him to better understand your  body. Plus, you never know when you’ll be able to cum if your man takes  the reigns which is a lot of fun!

## Some People Don’t Like Edging

Edging  isn’t for everyone. Some people find it frustrating. If backing off  from orgasm causes you to miss that window of opportunity to climax, and  to lose your orgasm during the session completely, then you will  naturally not like edging.

You  may also have to start over, without any of the residual buildup. Every  body is different, which is why it’s so important to pay attention to  yours. You know best!

Edging might be easier at some times rather  than others, which is perfectly okay. Although you might want to  encourage it, some sessions won’t be conducive to edging and a prolonged  build up. It’s okay to let that goal go for another time. After all,  what is edging helping if it’s only causing disappointment?

## Techniques for Edging During Sex, Foreplay or Masturbation

Edging  is all about getting right to that edge.. without going over. How  exactly do you do that? These three techniques are commonly used by fans  of edging.

### 1. Stop

The first technique might be the  easiest. Once you feel your orgasm approaching, just stop. Stop touching  yourself or doing anything else that is stimulating. Pause until the  feelings recede. Then, you or your partner can start stimulating your  body

Until…

You feel another orgasm approaching,

Then…

Stop again.

Repeat this process one, two, three or more times until you’re ready to finally climax.

Important:  Edging only works if you/your partner know how to pleasurably touch  you. So, if you don’t yet know what you like, check out this post with [masturbation techniques for women.](https://badgirlsbible.com/masturbation-techniques)

### 2. Switch It Up

Another  way to switch things up when edging is simply to use a different  technique than what you need to orgasm. This means you can still touch  your clitoris or G-spot, but you’re not actively doing whatever it is  that normally gets you off.

For example…

Perhaps you simply tap, pinch or press your clitoris instead of rubbing it in the way that normally brings you to orgasm.

[Discover clitoral stimulation techniques that are sure to lead to orgasm.](https://badgirlsbible.com/clitoral-stimulation)

Or  you may momentarily perform oral on your partner who is edging you  before he returns to stimulating you. That way, you’re still being  sexual, but you’re not careening toward an orgasm too fast.

You  can redirect your focus away from sexual stimulation entirely to prevent  yourself from cumming. One method you might find useful is to focus on  your breathing. As you get closer to the point of no return, your  breathing is probably quicker and more shallow, so taking the time to  focus on each breath and inhale and exhale more slowly is one of the  best unexpected edging techniques.

Or…

**Look for a distraction**

You  may want your mind and body focused on something other than how good it  feels if you have trouble with stopping yourself from climaxing.

This is a great time to try out a “painful” distraction if you’re into rough sex or S&M.

A  strategic bite or spanking can interrupt your orgasm, allowing you to  start back up later. Of course, if you’re the type who would cum from  (sudden) pain, then you might want to opt for a different technique.

### 3. Continuous Build

Instead of simply stopping all stimulation when you feel your orgasm is near, you can switch it up.

**Switch from clitoral stimulation –**  Perhaps you move from clitoral to vaginal stimulation if you usually  need clit stim to orgasm (and many women require clitoral stimulation or  prefer it to orgasm [[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0092623X.2017.1346530)]).  Try sensually rubbing your body (or your partner’s) or caressing your  breasts. Stroking of your labia or even anal play might feel nice enough  to keep you close to the edge but not quite intense enough to make you  orgasm.

**Keep it sensual –** If you focus on sensual  touches that still feel good, you’re not completely leaving the moment  or letting your body go back to zero as in the first edging technique  discussed.

**Slow it down –** One way to keep  yourself aroused but not quite orgasmic is simply to keep things slow  and steady rather than focusing on that buildup. If you typically aim to  get off as quickly as possible, this method might be a good method to  your utilitarian approach or masturbation.

Continuous edging might feel a bit more fluid and less jarring than the other techniques mentioned.

## Edging for Guys

You  don’t have to reinvent the wheel when you’re learning how to edge a  man. Instead, you can adopt the above techniques for him. Edging a guy  can be difficult, however, because you’re not in their body and you  don’t feel what they feel. You’ll need to pay close attention to his  body signs that indicate an orgasm is on its way.

The two of you  might also work out a system of words or other signals that he’s going  to cum soon if you don’t stop whatever it is that you’re doing that  feels so good.

Then you can pause or switch things up so he doesn’t cum immediately.

You’ll notice as you’re edging your man – or as he edges himself – that *he might partially or fully lose his erection.*  That’s completely normal as long as he still feels a little aroused.  You can increase stimulation if he’s softer so that he becomes erect or  semi-erect.

Because a man can orgasm separately from ejaculating,  there are a couple more edging techniques to try on your lover in your  quest to edge him:

**Scrotum Action –** When he’s  about to cum, one of you can reach between his legs and firmly wrap your  thumb and forefinger around his scrotum in a loop. Tug down gently but  firmly to prevent ejaculation.

**Control Sex –** Take control of his edging experience with a position such as [Cowgirl](https://badgirlsbible.com/cowgirl-sex-position), where you control the pace and depth of sex.

**The Scale –**  Introduce your partner to the edging scale of 1 to 10 and check with  him periodically to ensure he’s not going to orgasm. 1 means that he’s  NOT likely to cum. 9 or 10 means he’s about to orgasm. If you can’t tell  from his body and reactions how close he is to climaxing, then just ask  him where he is on the scale.

If you’re controlling his orgasms,  he might beg or plead to cum or for a certain type of sensation, but you  don’t have to give it to him! This might be a great way to [introduce domination to the bedroom](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-be-dominant).

Some  people argue that edging can help to make a man’s penis bigger, reduce  erectile dysfunction or even add years to his life because ejaculation  saps a man’s body of his “life force.” This might not be scientific, but  edging can definitely help him last longer in bed if premature  ejaculation is an issue. He can learn [more tips to last longer in bed in this guide](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-last-longer-in-bed).

## When to Let Yourself Orgasm

Once you master the art of edging, you might wonder when the right time to let yourself cum is.

The truth is…

There’s no right time.

It all depends.

You  might edge two or three times and let yourself cum. Or you may want to  see how long you can go and how impressive an orgasm you can have is!  Perhaps you try to see how many times you can edge in a given period.

Of  course, if building up to orgasm becomes much harder by edging or you  have a time limit, you might not be able to have a marathon edging  session, and that’s okay!

**Orgasm Control –** When you’re edging a partner, you might torture them a bit by not letting them cum (this is known as [orgasm denial](https://badgirlsbible.com/orgasm-denial)).  Edging and other orgasm play works great as a type of orgasm control  for precisely this reason. You could even not let him cum until he’s  achieved some goal (ie getting you off first or doing something super  unsexy such as filing away paperwork!).

And if edging becomes boring or is no longer fun, feel free to end things and get on with your day.

## Tips to Make Edging Even Better

Although we at the [Bad Girls Bible](https://badgirlsbible.com/)  absolutely recommend learning what edging is and how your body reacts  to it on your own, especially at first, it’s wonderful to add your  partner to the mix. One of the great aspects of edging with your lover  is the ability to tell him to tease you or not to let you orgasm!

Hopefully, your man will find this power over your body super sexy! More on [why power play is so hot](https://badgirlsbible.com/what-is-bdsm).

This  will definitely be the case if your partner is the dominant one, and  you may even be reading this article because your partner introduced you  to prolonged orgasms, and you didn’t know what they were called!

Secondly, we cannot emphasize how important it is to use enough [lube](https://badgirlsbible.com/what-is-lube),  especially if edging involves prolonged anal or vaginal penetration.  Even your clitoris and vulva might want a little of the slick stuff to  keep

## Common Issues with Edging for Girls

If you’re having trouble edging yourself, don’t worry. It’s a process, and **practice makes perfect**. Below, you’ll find solutions to some common problems with edging.

### You Cum When You Don’t Want to

This  is a result of simply stimulating yourself – or your partner – for too  long. Once you pass the point of no return, there’s nothing you can do.  To avoid this, you need to pay close attention to your body and the  signs that orgasm is impending. You need to stop before whatever sign  that an orgasm **will happen.**

**Learn Body Cues –**  To figure this out, you may need to slow things down and eliminate  distractions. Pay attention to exactly how your body feels before you  orgasm.

What does it do during the lead up?

Stop before that.

If you can’t stop in time, you might never learn how to edge.

**Use a 1-10 Scale –**  Imagine your arousal and proximity to orgasm on a scale of 1 to 10,  where 1 is not aroused or close to cumming at all and 10 is right on the  verge. Try to categorize where you are on the scale at any given time.  Whenever you’re higher than an 8 (7 if your point of no return is more  fleeting!), back off, slow down or stop what you’re doing entirely!

**Time It –** Alternatively, you can simply time when you stop stimulating or switch the method of stimulation.

This  is trickier because sometimes it will take you longer to cum than  others. But the basic idea is you should start with a time frame that  you know you *won’t* cum in, say, five minutes.

Then stop.

Increase that time in 30 to 60-second increments. Eventually, you’ll approach the limit of masturbation-without-orgasm.

**Use Signals –**  If you’re with a partner, you might need to work out a sign so whoever  is stimulating the other can stop or switch things up. If you’re solo  and using the technique where you simply switch things up but find  yourself still having an orgasm too soon, you might want to opt to  simply **stop** stimulating, instead.

### You Can’t Cum

Another issue you might run into is *not* being  able to cum. If you find it especially hard to orgasm or easy to “lose”  your orgasm, edging may simply not be for you. Edging works better if  your orgasms are more dependable.

But…

If yours are difficult or inconsistent, edging may simply result in lost orgasms and plenty of disappointment and frustration.

Don’t  be afraid to use tools such as a vibrator if it helps you cum more  consistently. That can help you unlock your ability to have an edging  orgasm. You can also learn how to remove roadblocks so [you can cum more often.](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-cum)

In  that case of losing your orgasm, you might wonder, “Is edging bad?” The  truth is, edging during sex or masturbation just isn’t for everyone.  You know your orgasms better than anyone else, so you’re the only one  who can make that judgment.

### You’re Bored

Edging can be a  way to spend more time having sex or masturbating. It might mean you  experiment with new techniques or have a more powerful orgasm when you  finally let yourself cum. There’s just one issue: it can get boring.

No  matter how good it feels to touch yourself or to be touched by your  partner, doing the same thing over and over might simply become bland.

If  you can’t keep the balance between sexual tension and longer time, you  might feel bored. This is especially true if your partner is trying to  edge you and you’re not in control.

You can ramp up sexual tension with:

- Dirty talk – [tips here](https://badgirlsbible.com/dirty-talk-phrases)
- Bondage and/or blindfolds
- Using sex toys
- Roleplay

Your  partner could also assign you a sexy task such as watching porn,  reading erotica, or talking about your fantasies that will make it  easier to stay in the moment.

Some of our advice for [tease and denial games](https://badgirlsbible.com/tease-and-denial) make for wonderful edging tips!

However,  you should definitely talk to your partner if you simply find it too  boring, especially if you’re bored because he’s the one who is edging so  he can last longer ([tips here](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-last-longer-in-bed))… but you just wind up staring at the ceiling rather than enjoying yourself.

**Keeping it short? –**  He can edge you fewer times or shorten the time of each “edge” or even  stick to more intense stimulation. Remember that edging could simply  take place over ten minutes with a couple of buildups rather than  needing half an hour, an hour or longer!

**Sometimes, not every time –**  And you don’t need to do sexual edging every time you’re between the  sheets. After all, a quickie can be fun. And if you frequently have  longer sex, it can really shake things up.

**Read More**: [All About Quickies](https://badgirlsbible.com/quickie)

Remember, however, that learning to edge can take a little practice. But if you keep at it, you can reap the benefits of edging.

**Experiment –**  When you first experiment with edging, you may lack the control it  takes to get it right, but don’t be hard on yourself. Keep practicing  either by yourself or with your partner, and you might soon be an edging  expert. However, if you’re already [having trouble reaching orgasm](https://badgirlsbible.com/how-to-orgasm) or edging just leaves you frustrated, there’s no rule that says you have to do it.

After all, different folks require different strokes – especially when it comes to sex!

## What the Science Says

No studies have been done on edging… yet. But you can understand edging a bit more if you understand **the sexual arousal cycle**, also known as the sexual response cycle. And knowing how it differs for men and women can also be quite enlightening.

The traditional arousal cycle starts with arousal (physical), moves to a plateau, reaches a high or orgasm, and then resolves [[2](https://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/stages-male-sexual-response)]. The typical graphic goes up, perhaps with a few bumps, and then falls steadily back down.

When  you edge, you’re switching up the cycle. The graph would climb toward a  plateau but move back down to arousal without hitting orgasm or  resolution. This continues every time you avoid an orgasm, so your  ultimate graph might have several humps.

Other types of arousal cycles have been suggested, especially for women who may not identify with the linear model [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27555507)].  One such model is non-linear, where arousal, desire, sexual stimuli,  satisfaction, and intimacy all feed into one another. An increase in one  can lead to an increase in another. Or a lack of one can lead to a lack  of another.

This nonlinear model, which was suggested by Rosemary Basson [[4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7858517_Women's_sexual_dysfunction_Revised_and_expanded_definitions?_sg=rRH_DjVh2t34EUjuyCqto1aIDdwACAQqkXmXiAsAkbHqBWhRY7NlLWcVvTuEN_N0NZttbJjvOdm-b9CC3SgrgCDV7q4ANUt8OA)],  can start at any location, too. This makes more sense for many women  than the original 4-phase sexual response cycle because women don’t  always feel aroused first. They often need something to motivate desire;  although, some women find themselves feeling desire after arousal and  stimulation has occurred.

Nonlinear response models may better  represent edging because there’s room for arousal to rise and fall  several times before orgasm. The standard model piques with orgasm,  followed by resolution, which requires a refractory period before the  cycle can start again [[5](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/sexual-response-cycle)]. It also better represents multiple orgasms.

Although many people enjoy edging, that’s not always the case. One woman writes about [how she finds her husband’s attempts at edging to be boring](https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/healthandlife/relationships/my-husband-has-started-edging-and-these-lengthy-sessions-are-making-me-bored-387872.html). It’s okay if edging isn’t for you or you only like to do it sparingly.

If  you’re willing to try edging, you might find yourself capable of  stronger orgasms, and your sex life can benefit from trying something  new. But edging isn’t right for everyone, especially those people who  have difficulty having orgasms, so you should proceed with caution if  that’s you.
