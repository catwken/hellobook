## Fisting Hands

Finding the perfect anatomical match between Top and Bottom can  greatly enhance the satisfaction and pleasure derived from fisting. 

### Characteristics

#### Left vs Right

Anatomy may determine which hand is better for play (both as a Top  and Bottom). For Bottoms, the fist chute may align better for depth  insertion with a left or right hand. For Tops, muscle development and  coordination may affect the flexibility, strength, and navigational  capacity of the penetrating hand and arm. 

#### Collapsibility

Some hands are able to collapse in on themselves to decrease the  overall diameter of the penetrating hand. If the meaty part of the palm  (connected to the thumb), can lay flat (or semi-flat) against the  opposite side of the palm (below the pinky), then a hand is considered  collapsible. These hands can be helpful in depth exercises and passing  through inner rings.

#### Size

Most fisters know the size of their hand on a simple scale of small  to extra large; however, glove makers classify hands in eight categories  of uni-sex hand measurements. Men sizing charts tend to start at XS at 7  inches and max out with XXL at 12 inches. 

| Hand Sizing Chart |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Size              | XXS  | XS   | S    | M    | L    | XL   | XXL  | XXXL |
| Circumference     | 6.5  | 7    | 7.5  | 8    | 9    | 9.5  | 10   | 11   |

Instructions on how to measure your hand are included [below](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108214211/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/as_hand.html#measure).  With size in mind,  every Bottom has limits—whether it be a finger, a fist, or a foot. Tops  and Bottoms should discuss realistic depth and girth before engaging in  play.

### Measuring Your Hand

Fisters generally reference hand measurement based on circumference,  with four particular categories: small, medium, large, and extra-large.  There are; however, three specific hand size measurements:  circumference, span, and length. Measurements from those three areas are  sufficient in providing 'general' hand sizes for fisting discussions.

A fourth measuring technique (used to  determine sizing for bangles) is the most accurate fisting measurement.  Unless your hand is atypical (extra-long fingers or extremely large  bones), report your hand size based on circumference or  bangle-circumference.

### Etiquette

Brachioproctic insertion involves—by definition—the fist chute and a  hand (or two). In order to guarantee the safety of both participants,  two simple rules apply to fisting and gloves:

- Hand inspections are required. The top should present his hands for inspection prior to fisting the Bottom. 
- Gloves are optional when agreed upon by both parties. The Bottom *always* gets to specify if gloves are required. Gloves, like condoms, should be discussed prior to arranging a session. 

If either party refuses to abide by these rules, then the fisting  should be aborted. The violation of boundaries prior to penetration does  not bode well for trust or confidence needed for elbow depth insertion.

   ## Advice and Tips from the Pros

   - [Sacred Art of Fisting: To Glove or Not to Glove](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108214211/http://unabatedspectrum.com/dfc/documents/advice_to_glove_or_not_to_glove.pdf)



## Fisting Raw

Many fisters, myself included, prefer raw fisting over gloves. Gloves  can be an irritant to the hole, and in depth fisting, provide little  protection to the top. When fisting raw, the Bottom should examine the  Top's hands to determine fisting readiness. 

### Nails

Nail Biters Welcome! Tops should trim nails as short as possible.  After trimming, a nail file should be used to eliminate sharper  points/edges that could cause miniscule cuts on in the smooth tissue of  the intestine. To test if your nails are too sharp, run them across your  tongue. If they are sharp enough to scratch your tongue, then trim and  file more. 

### Wounds

For depth fisting, the hand and arm of the Top need to be free of open wounds, cuts, scrapes, scabs, and infections.

- Fisting Tips without Gloves

- Before starting a session, wash both hands and arms with soap and water.
- Hand sanitizer is great for when hosting and  travelling. A Bottom can request that the Top apply the sanitizer to  ensure cleanliness prior to insertion. 
- Nail files should be a staple in the supply bag  of both Tops and Bottoms. You should generally provide your own clippers  and files.



## Fisting Under Cover (Gloved)

Despite the connection with raw fisting, there are men that prefer  gloving up or having a protective barrier when penetration of any sort  is involved.

### Glove Pros & Cons

As mentioned previously, it is always the Bottom's choice when it  comes to using gloves in a fisting scene. There are several pros and  cons that affect his determination.

PROS

- Faster cleanup for tops
- Intestinal protection against sparper nails
- Smoother penetration in descending colon
- Easier to spot pinkness/blood on light gloves
- Protection against certain STIs for both parties
- Protection against other infections, especially with weaker immune systems*
- Psychological barriers affects connection
- Eliminates pre-fisting checklists in anonymous/dark room fisting events

CONS

- Protection limited to size of glove
- Lube restrictions based on glove type
- Lubrication wipes off easily, increasing drag
- Drag due to wrinkles irritates hole
- Increased drag in sigmoid colon
- Allergies due to material of glove
- Reduced sensation increases puncture risk
- Psychological barriers affects connection





### Choosing Your Glove

If gloves are a required part of the scene, then you should consider  the following qualities when stocking your supply warehouse: 

- Color - Gloves come in all colors and  for fisting, black or red gloves might seem appropriate; however, you  should consider lighter gloves that will show any pink or red from  bleeding. 
- Sterile/Non-sterile - Gloves can be  purchased as sterile or non-sterile, though the value of non-sterile  gloves for fisting is limited. As soon as  you touch the lube bottle,  your gloves are contaminated.
- Size - Ill-fitting gloves cause drag  through the lower fist chute, increasing injury and decreasing the  duration of play. Stock your supply with multiple sizes so that gloves  will fit the hand of the top.
- Material - Nitrile, latex, rubber, and  vinyl are all variations in materials used for gloves. Some lubes do  not interact well with your glove material. Rubber and vinyl gloves do  not fit the hand well increase drag. Rubber gloves, while reusable,  require cleaning and sanitizing immediately after play.

### Glove Size Charts

The wrong size of glove for a Top's hand can wreak havoc on the  Bottom's hole and result in early termination of the session. The  following sizing charts are helpful in determining glove size:

| Unisex Gloves          |      |      |         |         |          |           |           |      |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ---- | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | ---- |
| Size                   | XXS  | XS   | S       | M       | L        | XL        | XXL       | XXXL |
| Circumference          | 6.5  | 7    | 7.5     | 8       | 9        | 9.5       | 10        | 11   |
| Men's Gloves           |      |      |         |         |          |           |           |      |
| Size                   | XXS  | XS   | S       | M       | L        | XL        | XXL       | XXXL |
| Circumference          | -    | 7    | 7.5 - 8 | 8.5 - 9 | 9.5 - 10 | 10.5 - 11 | 11.5 - 12 | -    |
| Bangles / True Fisting |      |      |         |         |          |           |           |      |
| Size                   | XXS  | XS   | S       | M       | L        | XL        | XXL       | XXXL |
| Circumference          | 7    | 7.5  | 8       | 8.5     | 9.5      | 10        | 11        | 12+  |

### Integrating Gloves Into Your Scene

You should lay out gloves prior to your scene in a sanitary location,  free from material that will contaminate them. Although they are  probably not sterile gloves, it is inappropriate to introduce additional  risk to the bottom by exposing gloves to infectious material or filth.



Set up a glove station on a towel or other clean surface that has  three or four pairs of gloves for you to easily grab during play. You  may need paper towels or non-carcinogenic powder readily available to  dry your hands prior to putting on gloves. You might also consider a  dispenser if your playroom has the appropriate space.



- Fisting Tips with Gloves

- Flip the glove inside out when getting ready to  fist. There is often less drag when inverted due to seams in the  manufacturing process.
- Avoid colored gloves that mask warning signs  when fisting. It is difficult to see blood with red, black, and dark  colored gloves. 
- A dash of powder inside the glove or on the hand  helps it slide right on. Any powder used should be organic, for  example, cornstarch. Talcum powder is carcinogenic and an irritant to  hole tissue.
- When using gloves, double the amount of lubrication used when fisting raw.

## Storytime: Stumped

### Never Fight a Bear

It was a cold Montana eveining the first time I laid eyes on Eric. He  had been in town recruiting for the National Park Service, and I had  been working in Big Sky Country. When he opened the door, something was  missing. It wasn't the connection, as he had a beautiful smile, a huge  cock, a great personality, and a devious sensibility about him. Those  things were all in great supply. Still... there was something missing.

We kissed immediately, and our sexual communion grew more intense and  carnal by the minute. Fuck that beast was huge on him, and he fucked my  hole like there *really* was no tomorrow. These were the  pre-PrEP days, so I dismounted before his load gushed out of his cock  like the pent-up waters of Old Faithful. Damn that stuff kept on cumming  and cumming and cumming *and* coming. Awesome beyond compare: the width, the girth, the volume, the trajectory, the release. 

As we laid there together in the afterglow of some cosmic orgasm's I asked:

'*What happened here?*'

'*This?*' he said, holding up his arm. '*A bear got a hold of it!*'

'*A bear? Like a grizzly or black bear*? I replied.

'*Well, it certainly wasn't a gay bear--I could of at least fended off one of those successfully.*' 

We laughed and discussed the incident with all of the literal gory  details. My perverted mind went into overdrive mode, but sleep called my  name and my exhausted body was only too willing to oblige...

Fast forward several hours. A slight pressure is building around my  hole and I'm liking it. His cock felt so great and my hole wanted more.  But something was different. It was thicker, and definitely longer. Much  longer...  ...and oh so much deeper. Holy Fuck, that's his elbow and  bicep!

And then I woke up, back in my hotel room, from the most awesome and  foreshadowing dream to ever cross my pillow. Hopefully, he was dreaming  the same thing.

Eric and I still text, and now that I'm more open regarding my  proclivities, I asked his thoughts on stump fisting. He told me that he  wanted to stump me since the moment I knocked on the door. Damn  opportunities missed!
